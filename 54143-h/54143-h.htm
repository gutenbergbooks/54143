<h2><i>FORECAST.</i></h2>

<p class="dropcap">The printers ask if there is to be prefatory
matter.</p>

<p>There shall be no excuses, nor any defensive explanations:
and I shall only give here such forecast
of this little book as may serve as a reminder,
and appetizer, for the kindly acquaintances I meet
once more; and further serve as an illustrative
<em>menu</em>, for the benefit of those newer and more
critical friends who browse tentatively at the
tables of the booksellers.</p>

<p>This volume&mdash;the fourth in its series of English
Lands and Letters&mdash;opens upon that always
delightful country of hills and waters, which is
known as the Lake District of England;&mdash;where
we found Wordsworth, stalking over the fells&mdash;and
where we now find the maker of those heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
poems of <cite>Thalaba</cite> and <cite>Madoc</cite>, and of the charming
little biography of Nelson. There, too, we find
that strange creature, De Quincey, full of a
tumult of thoughts and language&mdash;out of which
comes ever and anon some penetrating utterance,
whose barb of words fixes it in the mind, and
makes it rankle. Professor Wilson is his fellow,
among the hills by Elleray&mdash;as strenuous, and
weightier with his great bulk of Scottish manhood;
the <cite>Isle of Palms</cite> is forgotten; but not
“Christopher in his Shooting Jacket”&mdash;stained,
and bespattered with Highland libations.</p>

<p>A Londoner we encounter&mdash;Crabb Robinson,
full of gossip and conventionalities; and also that
cautious, yet sometimes impassioned Scottish bard
who sang of <cite>Hohenlinden</cite>, and of <cite>Gertrude of
Wyoming</cite>. Next, we have asked readers to share
our regalement, in wandering along the Tweed
banks, and in rekindling the memories of the
verse, the home, and the chivalric stories of the
benign master of Abbotsford, for whom&mdash;whatever
newer literary fashions may now claim allegiance
and whatever historic <i lang="la">quid-nuncs</i> may say
in derogation&mdash;I think there are great multitudes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
who will keep a warm place in their hearts and
easily pardon a kindred warmth in our words.</p>

<p>After Dryburgh, and its pall, we have in these
pages found our way to Edinboro’, and have
sketched the beginners, and the beginnings of
that great northern quarterly, which so long dominated
the realm of British book-craft, and which
rallied to its ranks such men as Jeffrey and the
witty Sydney Smith, and Mackintosh and the
pervasive and petulant Brougham&mdash;full of power
and of pyrotechnics. These great names and
their quarterly organ call up comparison with that
other, southern and distinctive Quarterly of Albemarle
Street, which was dressed for literary battle
by writers like Gifford, Croker, Southey, and
Lockhart.</p>

<p>The Prince Regent puts in an appearance in
startling waistcoats and finery&mdash;vibrating between
Windsor and London; so does the bluff Sailor-King
William IV. Next, Walter Savage Landor
leads the drifting paragraphs of our story&mdash;a
great, strong man; master of classicism, and
master of language; now tender, and now virulent;
never quite master of himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>Of Leigh Hunt, and of his graceful, light-weighted,
gossipy literary utterance, there is indulgent
mention, with some delightful passages of
verse foregathered from his many books. Of
Thomas Moore, too, there is respectful and grateful&mdash;if
not over-exultant&mdash;talk; yet in these swift
days there be few who are tempted to tarry long in
the “rosy bowers by Bendemeer.”</p>

<p>From Moore and the brilliant fopperies of “The
First Gentleman of Europe,” we slip to the disorderly,
but pungent and vivid essays of Hazlitt&mdash;to
the orderly and stately historic labors of
Hallam, closing up our chapter with the gay company
who used to frequent the brilliant salon of
the Lady Blessington&mdash;first in Seamore Place, and
later at Gore House. There we find Bulwer,
Disraeli (in his flamboyant youth-time), the
elegant Count d’Orsay, and others of that train-band.</p>

<p>Following quickly upon these, we have asked
our readers to fare with us along the old and
vivid memories of Newstead Abbey&mdash;to track the
master-poet of his time, through his early days of
romance and marriage&mdash;through his journeyings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
athwart Europe, from the orange groves of Lisbon
to the olives of Thessaly&mdash;from his friendship
with Shelley, and life at Meillerie with its loud
joys and stains&mdash;through his wild revels of
Venice&mdash;his masterly verse-making&mdash;his quietudes
of Ravenna (where the Guiccioli shone)&mdash;through
his passionate zeal for Greece, and his
last days at Missolonghi, with one brief glimpse of
his final resting-place, beside his passionate Gordon
mother, under the grim, old tower of Hucknall-Torkard.
So long indeed do we dwell upon
this Byronic episode, as to make of it the virtual
<i lang="fr">pièce de résistance</i> in the literary <i lang="fr">menu</i> of these
pages.</p>

<p>After the brusque and noisy King William there
trails royally into view that Sovereign Victoria,
over whose blanched head&mdash;in these very June
days in which I write&mdash;the bells are all ringing
a joyous Jubilee for her sixtieth year of reign.
But to our eye, and to these pages, she comes as
a girl in her teens&mdash;modest, yet resolute and
calm; and among her advisers we see the suave
and courtly Melbourne; and among those who
make parliamentary battle, in the Queen’s young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
years, that famed historian who has pictured the
lives of her kinsfolk&mdash;William and Mary&mdash;in a
way which will make them familiar in the ages to
come.</p>

<p>We have a glimpse, too, of the jolly Captain
Marryat cracking his for’castle jokes, and of the
somewhat tedious, though kindly, G. P. R. James,
lifting his chivalric notes about men-at-arms and
knightly adventures&mdash;a belated hunter in the
fields of ancient feudal gramarye.</p>

<p>And with this pennant of the old times of
tourney flung to the sharp winds of these days,
and shivering in the rude blasts&mdash;where anarchic
threats lurk and murmur&mdash;we close our preface,
and bid our readers all welcome to the spread of&mdash;what
our old friend Dugald Dalgetty would
call&mdash;the <em>Vivers</em>.</p>

<h1><i>ENGLISH LANDS, LETTERS,
&amp; KINGS.</i></h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">The reader will, perhaps, remember that we
brought our last year’s ramble amongst
British Lands and Letters to an end&mdash;in the
charming Lake District of England. There, we
found Coleridge, before he was yet besotted by
his opium-hunger; there, too, we had Church-interview
with the stately, silver-haired poet of
Rydal Mount&mdash;making ready for his last Excursion
into the deepest of Nature’s mysteries.</p>

<p>The reader will recall, further, how this poet
and seer, signalized some of the later years of his
life by indignant protests against the schemes&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
were then afoot&mdash;for pushing railways
among the rural serenities of Westmoreland.</p>

<h3>The Lake Country.</h3>

<p>It is no wonder; for those Lake counties are
very beautiful,&mdash;as if, some day, all the tamer
features of English landscape had been sifted out,
and the residue of picturesqueness and salient objects
of flood and mountain had been bunched
together in those twin regions of the Derwent
and of Windermere. Every American traveller is
familiar, of course, with the charming glimpses
of Lake Saltonstall from the Shore-line high-road
between New York and Boston; let them imagine
these multiplied by a score, at frequently recurring
intervals of walk or drive; not bald duplications;
for sometimes the waters have longer
stretch, and the hills have higher reach, and
fields have richer culture and more abounding
verdure; moreover, occasional gray church towers
lift above the trees, and specks of villages
whiten spots in the valleys; and the smoothest
and hardest of roads run along the margin of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
lakes; and masses of ivy cover walls, and go rioting
all over the fronts of wayside inns. Then,
mountains as high as Graylock, in Berkshire, pile
suddenly out of the quieter undulations of surface,
with high-lying ponds in their gulches;
there are deep swales of heather, and bald rocks,
and gray stone cairns that mark the site of ancient
Cumbrian battles.</p>

<p>No wonder that a man loving nature and loving
solitude, as Wordsworth did love them, should
have demurred to the project of railways, and
have shuddered&mdash;as does Ruskin now&mdash;at the
whistling of the demon of civilization among those
hills. But it has come there, notwithstanding,
and come to stay; and from the station beyond
Bowness, upon the charmingest bit of Windermere,
there lies now only an early morning’s walk
to the old home of Wordsworth at Rydal. Immediately
thereabout, it is true, the levels are a little
more puzzling to the engineers, so that the
thirteen miles of charming country road which
stretch thence&mdash;twirling hither and yon, and up
and down&mdash;in a northwesterly direction to the
town of Keswick and the Derwent valley, remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
now in very much the same condition as when I
walked over them, in leisurely way, fifty odd years
ago this coming spring. The road in passing out
from Rydal village goes near the cottage where
poor Hartley Coleridge lived, and earlier, that
strange creature De Quincey (of whom we shall
have presently more to say); it skirts the very
margin of Grasmere Lake; this latter being at
your left, while upon the right you can almost see
among the near hills the famous “Wishing Gate;”
farther on is Grasmere village, and Grasmere
church-yard&mdash;in a corner of which is the grave
of the old poet, and a modest stone at its head
on which is graven only the name, William Wordsworth,&mdash;as
if anything more were needed! A
mile or two beyond, one passes the “Swan Inn,”
and would like to lodge there, and maybe clamber
up Helvellyn, which here shows its great hulk
on the right&mdash;no miniature mountain, but one
which would hold its own (3,000 feet) among the
lesser ones which shoulder up the horizon at
“Crawford’s,” in the White Mountains.</p>

<p>Twirling and winding along the flank of Helvellyn,
the road comes presently upon the long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Dunmail Rise, where a Cumbrian battle was
fought, and where, some six hundred feet above
the level of Rydal water, one plunges into mountain
savagery. All the while Helvellyn is rising
like a giant on the right, and on the left is the
lake of Thirlmere, with its shores of precipice.
An hour more of easy walking brings one to
another crest of hill from which the slope is
northward and westward, and from this point
you catch sight of the great mass of Skiddaw;
while a little hitherward is the white speckle of
Keswick town; and stretching away from it to
your left lies all the valley of Derwent Water&mdash;with
a cleft in the hills at its head, down which
the brooklet of Lodore comes&mdash;“splashing and
flashing.”</p>

<h3>Robert Southey.</h3>

<p>I have taken the reader upon this stroll through
a bit of the Lake country of England that we
might find the poet Dr. Southey<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in his old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
home at Keswick. It is not properly in the town,
but just across the Greta River, which runs southward
of the town. There, the modest but good-sized
house has been standing for these many
years upon a grassy knoll, in its little patch of
quiet lawn, with scattered show of trees&mdash;but
never so many as to forbid full view up the long
stretch of Derwent Water. His own hexameters
shall tell us something of this view:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent3">“I stood at the window beholding</div>
<div class="verse">Mountain and lake and vale; the valley disrobed of its verdure;</div>
<div class="verse">Derwent, retaining yet from eve a glassy reflection</div>
<div class="verse">Where his expanded breast, then still and smooth as a mirror,</div>
<div class="verse">Under the woods reposed; the hills that calm and majestic</div>
<div class="verse">Lifted their heads into the silent sky, from far Glaramara,</div>
<div class="verse">Bleacrag, and Maidenmawr to Grisedal and westernmost Wython,</div>
<div class="verse">Dark and distinct they rose. The clouds had gathered above them</div>
<div class="verse">High in the middle air, huge purple pillowy masses,</div>
<div class="verse">While in the West beyond was the last pale tint of the twilight,</div>
<div class="verse">Green as the stream in the glen, whose pure and chrysolite waters</div>
<div class="verse">Flow o’er a schistous bed.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This may be very true picturing; but it has not the
abounding flow of an absorbing rural enthusiasm;
there is too sharp a search in it for the assonance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the spondees and the alliteration&mdash;to say nothing
of the mineralogy. Indeed, though Southey
loved those country ways and heights, of which I
have given you a glimpse, and loved his daily walks
round about Keswick and the Derwent, and loved
the bracing air of the mountains&mdash;I think he
loved these things as the feeders and comforters
of his physical rather than of his spiritual nature.
We rarely happen, in his verse, upon such transcripts
of out-of-door scenes as are inthralling,
and captivate our finer senses; nor does he make
the boughs and blossoms tell such stories as filtered
through the wood-craft of Chaucer.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, it is to that home of Southey,
in the beautiful Lake country, that we must
go for our most satisfying knowledge of the man.
He was so wedded to it; he so loved the murmur
of the Greta; so loved his walks; so loved the
country freedom; so loved his workaday clothes
and cap and his old shoes;<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> so loved his books&mdash;double-deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
in his library, and running over into
hall and parlor and corridors; loved, too, the children’s
voices that were around him there&mdash;not his
own only, but those always next, and almost his
own&mdash;those of the young Coleridges. These were
stranded there, with their mother (sister of Mrs.
Southey), owing to the rueful neglect of their
father&mdash;the bard and metaphysician. I do not
think this neglect was due wholly to indifference.
Coleridge sidled away from his wife and left her
at Keswick in that old home of his own,&mdash;where
he knew care was good&mdash;afraid to encounter her
clear, honest, discerning&mdash;though unsympathetic&mdash;eyes,
while he was putting all resources and all
subterfuges to the feeding of that opiate craze
which had fastened its wolfish fangs upon his very
soul.</p>

<p>And Southey had most tender and beautiful
care for those half-discarded children of the “Ancient
Mariner.” He writes in this playful vein
to young Hartley (then aged eleven), who is
away on a short visit:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Jackson has bought a cow, but he has had no calf
since you left him. Edith [his own daughter] grows like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
a young giantess, and has a disposition to bite her arm,
which you know is a very foolish trick. Your [puppy]
friend Dapper, who is, I believe, your God-dog, is in good
health, though he grows every summer graver than the last.
I am desired to send you as much love as can be enclosed in
a letter. I hope it will not be charged double on that account
at the post-office. But there is Mrs. Wilson’s love,
Mr. Jackson’s, your Aunt Southey’s, your Aunt Lovell’s and
Edith’s; with a <em>purr</em> from Bona Marietta [the cat], an
open-mouthed kiss from Herbert [the baby], and three
wags of the tail from Dapper. I trust they will all arrive
safe. Yr. dutiful uncle.”</p>

</div>

<p>And the same playful humor, and disposition
to evoke open-eyed wonderment, runs up and down
the lines of that old story of Bishop Hatto and
the rats; and that other smart slap at the barbarities
of war&mdash;which young people know, or ought
to know, as the “Battle of Blenheim”&mdash;wherein
old Kaspar says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent6">“it was a shocking sight</div>
<div class="verse indent1">After the field was won;</div>
<div class="verse">For many thousand bodies here</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Lay rotting in the sun.</div>
<div class="verse">But things like that, you know, must be,</div>
<div class="verse">After a famous Victory.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Great praise the Duke of Marlboro’ won</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And our good Prince Eugene;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
<div class="verse">‘Why, ’twas a very wicked thing!’</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Said little Wilhelmine.</div>
<div class="verse">‘Nay&mdash;nay&mdash;my little girl,’ quoth he,</div>
<div class="verse">‘It was a famous Victory.’”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Almost everybody has encountered these Southeyan
verses, and that other, about Mary the
“Maid of the Inn,” in some one or other of the
many “collections” of drifting poetry. There
are very few, too, who have not, some day, read that
most engaging little biography of Admiral Nelson,
which tells, in most straightforward and simple
and natural way, the romantic story of a life full
of heroism, and scored with stains. I do not
know, but&mdash;with most people&mdash;a surer and more
lasting memory of Southey would be cherished by
reason of those unpretending writings already
named, and by knowledge of his quiet, orderly,
idyllic home-life among the Lakes of Cumberland&mdash;tenderly
and wisely provident of the mixed
household committed to his care&mdash;than by the
more ambitious things he did, or by the louder
life he lived in the controversialism and politics
of the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<h3>His Early Life.</h3>

<p>To judge him more nearly we must give a slight
trace of his history. Born down in Bristol (in
whose neighborhood we found, you will remember,
Chatterton, Mistress More, Coleridge, and
others)&mdash;he was the son of a broken down linen-draper,
who could help him little; but a great
aunt&mdash;a starched woman of the Betsey Trotwood
stamp&mdash;could and did befriend him, until it
came to her knowledge, on a sudden, that he was
plotting emigration to the Susquehanna, and plotting
marriage with a dowerless girl of Bristol;
then she dropped him, and the guardian aunt
appears nevermore.</p>

<p>An uncle, however, who is a chaplain in the
British service, helps him to Oxford&mdash;would have
had him take orders&mdash;in which case we should
have had, of a certainty, some day, Bishop
Southey; and probably a very good one. But he
has some scruples about the Creed, being over-weighted,
perhaps, by intercourse with young
Coleridge on the side of Unitarianism: “Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
atom of grass,” he says, “is worth all the Fathers.”<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
He, however, accompanies the uncle
to Portugal; dreams dreams and has poetic visions
there in the orange-groves of Cintra; projects,
too, a History of Portugal&mdash;which project
unfortunately never comes to fulfilment. He falls
in with the United States Minister, General Humphreys,
who brings to his notice Dwight’s “Conquest
of Canaan,” which Southey is good enough
to think “has some merit.”</p>

<p>Thereafter he comes back to his young wife; is
much in London and thereabout; coming to know
Charles Lamb, Rogers, and Moore, with other
such. He is described at that day as tall&mdash;a
most presentable man&mdash;with dark hair and eyes,
wonderful arched brows; “head of a poet,”
Byron said; looking up and off, with proud foretaste
of the victories he will win; he has, too,
very early, made bold literary thrust at that old
story of Joan of Arc: a good topic, of large human
interest, but not over successfully dealt with by
him. After this came that extraordinary poem of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
<cite>Thalaba</cite>, the first of a triad of poems which excited
great literary wonderment (the others being
the <cite>Curse of Kehama</cite> and <cite>Madoc</cite>). They are
rarely heard of now and scarcely known. Beyond
that fragment from <cite>Kehama</cite>, beginning</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“They sin who tell us Love can die,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">hardly a page from either has drifted from the
high sea of letters into those sheltered bays where
the makers of anthologies ply their trade. Yet no
weak man could have written either one of these
almost forgotten poems of Southey; recondite
learning makes its pulse felt in them; bright
fancies blaze almost blindingly here and there;
old myths of Arabia and Welsh fables are galvanized
and brought to life, and set off with special
knowledge and cumbrous aids of stilted and redundant
prosody; but all is utterly remote from
human sympathies, and all as cold&mdash;however it
may attract by its glitter&mdash;as the dead hand</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Shrivelled, and dry, and black,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">which holds the magic taper in the Dom Daniel
cavern of <cite>Thalaba</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>A fourth long poem&mdash;written much later in
life&mdash;<cite>Roderick the Goth</cite>, has a more substantial
basis of human story, and so makes larger appeal
to popular interest; but it had never a marked
success.</p>

<p>Meantime, Southey has not kept closely by
London; there have been peregrinations, and
huntings for a home&mdash;for children and books
must have a settlement. Through friends of influence
he had come to a fairly good political appointment
in Ireland, but has no love for the bulls
and blunderbusses which adorn life there; nor will
he tutor his patron’s boys&mdash;which also comes
into the scale of his duties&mdash;so gives up that
chance of a livelihood. There is, too, a new trip
to Portugal with his wife; and a new reverent
and dreamy listening to the rustle of the shining
leaves of the orange-trees of Cintra. I do not
think those murmurous tales of the trees of Portugal,
burdened with old monastic flavors, ever
went out of his ears wholly till he died. But
finally the poet does come to settlement, somewhere
about 1803&mdash;in that Keswick home, where
we found him at the opening of our chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<h3>Greta Hall.</h3>

<p>Coleridge is for awhile a fellow-tenant with him
there, then blunders away to Grasmere&mdash;to London,
to Highgate, and into that over-strained,
disorderly life of which we know so much and
yet not enough. But Southey does not lack self-possession,
or lack poise: he has not indeed so
much brain to keep on balance; but he thinks
excellently well of his own parts; he is disgusted
when people look up to him after his Irish appointment&mdash;“as
if,” he said, “the author of
<cite>Joan of Arc</cite>, and of <cite>Thalaba</cite>, were made a great
man by scribing for the Chancellor of the Exchequer.”</p>

<p>Yet for that poem of <cite>Thalaba</cite>, in a twelve-month
after issue, he had only received as his share
of profits a matter of £3 15s. Indeed, Southey
would have fared hardly money-wise in those
times, if he had not won the favor of a great many
good and highly placed friends; and it was only
four years after his establishment at Keswick,
when these friends succeeded in securing to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
an annual Government pension of £200. Landor
had possibly aided him before this time; he certainly
had admired greatly his poems and given
praise that would have been worth more, if he had
not spoiled it by rating Southey as a poet so much
above Byron, Scott, and Coleridge.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>In addition to these aids the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>
was set afoot in those days in London&mdash;of which
sturdy defender of Church and State, Southey
soon became a virtual pensioner. Moreover, with
his tastes, small moneys went a long way; he was
methodical to the last degree; he loved his old
coats and habits; he loved his marches and countermarches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
among the hills that flank Skiddaw
better than he loved horses, or dogs, or guns; a
quiet evening in his library with his books, was
always more relished than ever so good a place at
Drury Lane. New friends and old brighten that
retirement for him. He has his vacation runs to
Edinboro’&mdash;to London&mdash;to Bristol; the children
are growing (though there is death of one little
one&mdash;away from home); the books are piling up
in his halls in bigger and always broader ranks.
He writes of Brazil, of Spanish matters, of new
poetry, of Nelson, of Society&mdash;showing touches
of his early radicalism, and of a Utopian humor,
which age and the heavy harness of conventionalism
he has learned to wear, do not wholly destroy.
He writes of Wesley and of the Church&mdash;settled
in those maturer years into a comfortable routine-ordered
Churchism, which does not let too airy a
conscience prick him into unrest. A good, safe
monarchist, too, who comes presently, and rightly
enough&mdash;through a suggestion of George IV.,
then Regent in place of crazy George III.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>&mdash;by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
his position as Poet Laureate; and in that capacity
writes a few dismally stiff odes, which are his
worst work. Even Wordsworth, who walks over
those Cumberland hills with reverence, and with a
pious fondness traces the “star-shaped shadows on
the naked stones”&mdash;cannot warm to Southey’s
new gush over royalty in his New Year’s Odes.
Coleridge chafes; and Landor, we may be sure,
sniffs, and swears, with a great roar of voice, at
what looks so like to sycophancy.</p>

<p>To this time belongs that ode whose vengeful
lines, after the fall of Napoleon, whip round the
Emperor’s misdeeds in a fury of Tory Anglicanism,
and call on France to avenge her wrongs:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">No, no; Southey was no Milton&mdash;does not reach
to the height of an echo of Milton.</p>

<p>Yet he was a rare and accomplished man of
books&mdash;of books rather than genius, I think. An
excellent type of the very clever and well-trained
professional writer, working honestly and steadily
in the service to which he has put himself. Very
politic, too, in his personal relations. Even
Carlyle&mdash;for a wonder&mdash;speaks of him without
lacerating him.</p>

<p>In a certain sense he was not insincere; yet he
had none of that out-spoken exuberant sincerity
which breaks forth in declaratory speech, before
the public time-pieces have told us how to pitch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
our voices. Landor had this: so had Coleridge.
Southey never would have run away from his wife&mdash;never;
he might dislike her; but Society’s great
harness (if nothing more) would hold him in
check; there were conditions under which Coleridge
might and did. Southey would never over-drink
or over-tipple; there were conditions (not
rare) under which Coleridge might and did. Yet,
for all this, I can imagine a something finer in
the poet of the <cite>Ancient Mariner</cite>&mdash;that felt moral
chafings far more cruelly; and for real poetic
unction you might put <cite>Thalaba</cite>, and <cite>Kehama</cite>,
and <cite>Madoc</cite> all in one scale, and only <cite>Christabel</cite>
in the other&mdash;and the Southey poems would be
bounced out of sight. But how many poets of
the century can put a touch to verse like the
touch in <cite>Christabel</cite>?</p>

<h3>The Doctor and Last Shadows.</h3>

<p>I cannot forbear allusion to that curious book&mdash;little
read now&mdash;which was published by Southey
anonymously, called <cite>The Doctor</cite>:<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> a book showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
vast accumulation of out-of-the-way bits
of learning&mdash;full of quips, and conceits, and
oddities; there are traces of Sterne in it and of
Rabelais; but there is little trenchant humor of
its own. It is a literary jungle; and all its wit
sparkles like marsh fire-flies that lead no whither.
You may wonder at its erudition; wonder at its
spurts of meditative wisdom; wonder at its
touches of scholastic cleverness, and its want of
any effective coherence, but you wonder more at
its waste of power. Yet he had great pride in
this book; believed it would be read admiringly
long after him; enjoyed vastly a boyish dalliance&mdash;if
not a lying by-play&mdash;with the secret of its
authorship; but he was, I think, greatly aggrieved
by its want of the brilliant success he had hoped
for.</p>

<p>But sorrows of a more grievous sort were dawning
on him. On the very year before the publication
of the first volumes of <cite>The Doctor</cite>, he writes
to his old friend, Bedford: “I have been parted
from my wife by something worse than death.
Forty years she has been the life of my life; and
I have left her this day in a lunatic asylum.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>But she comes back within a year&mdash;quiet, but
all beclouded; looking vacantly upon the faces of
the household, saddened, and much thinned now.
For the oldest boy Herbert is dead years since;
and the daughter, Isabel, “the most radiant creature
(he says) that I ever beheld, or shall behold”&mdash;dead
too; his favorite niece, Sara Coleridge,
married and gone; his daughter Edith, married
and gone; and now that other Edith&mdash;his wife&mdash;looking
with an idle stare around the almost
empty house. It was at this juncture, when all
but courage seemed taken from him, that Sir
Robert Peel wrote, offering the poet a Baronetcy;
but he was beyond taking heart from any such
toy as this. He must have felt a grim complacency&mdash;now
that his hair was white and his
shoulders bowed by weight of years and toil, and
his home so nearly desolate&mdash;in refusing the
empty bauble which Royalty offered, and in staying&mdash;plain
Robert Southey.</p>

<p>Presently thereafter his wife died; and he, whose
life had been such a domestic one, strayed round
the house purposeless, like a wheel spinning
blindly&mdash;off from its axle. Friends, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
took him away with them to Paris; among these
friends&mdash;that always buoyant and companionable
Crabb Robinson, whose diary is so rich in reminiscences
of the literary men of these times.
Southey’s son Cuthbert went with him, and the
poet made a good mock of enjoying the new
scenes; plotted great work again&mdash;did labor
heartily on his return, and two years thereafter
committed the indiscretion of marrying again:
the loneliness at Keswick was so great. The
new mistress he had long known and esteemed;
and she (Miss Caroline Bowles) was an excellent,
kindly, judicious woman&mdash;although a poetess.</p>

<p>But it was never a festive house again. All the
high lights in that home picture which was set
between Skiddaw and the Derwent-water were
blurred. Wordsworth, striding across the hills by
Dunmail Rise, on one of his rare visits, reports
that Southey is all distraught; can talk of nothing
but his books; and presently&mdash;counting only
by months&mdash;it appears that he will not even talk
of these&mdash;will talk of nothing. His handwriting,
which had been neat&mdash;of which he had been
proud&mdash;went all awry in a great scrawl obliquely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
athwart the page. For a year or two he is in
this lost trail; mumbling, but not talking; seeing
things&mdash;yet as one who sees not; clinging to
those loved books of his&mdash;fondling them; passing
up and down the library to find this or the
other volume that had been carefully cherished&mdash;taking
them from their shelves; putting his lips
to them&mdash;then replacing them;&mdash;a year or more
of this automatic life&mdash;the light in him all
quenched.</p>

<p>He died in 1843, and was buried in the pretty
church-yard of Crosthwaite, a short mile away
from his old home. Within the church is a beautiful
recumbent figure of the poet, which every
traveller should see.</p>

<h3>Crabb Robinson.</h3>

<p>I had occasion to name Crabb Robinson<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> as
one of the party accompanying Southey on his
last visit to the Continent. Robinson was a man
whom it is well to know something of, by reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
of his Boswellian <cite>Reminiscences</cite>, and because&mdash;though
of comparatively humble origin&mdash;he grew
to be an excellent type of the well-bred, well-read
club-man of his day&mdash;knowing everybody who
was worth knowing, from Mrs. Siddons to Walter
Scott, and talking about everybody who was worth
talking of, from Louis Phillippe to Mrs. Barbauld.</p>

<p>He was quick, of keen perception&mdash;always
making the most of his opportunities; had fair
schooling; gets launched somehow upon an attorney’s
career, to which he never took with great
enthusiasm. He was an apt French scholar&mdash;passed
four or five years, too, studying in Germany;
his assurance and intelligence, aptitude,
and good-nature bringing him to know almost
everybody of consequence. He is familiar with
Madame de Staël&mdash;hob-nobs with many of the
great German writers of the early part of this century&mdash;is
for a time correspondent of the <cite>Times</cite>
from the Baltic and Stockholm; and from Spain
also, in the days when Bonaparte is raging over
the Continent. He returns to London, revives
old acquaintances, and makes new ones; knows
Landor and Dyer and Campbell; is hail fellow&mdash;as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
would seem&mdash;with Wordsworth, Southey,
Moore, and Lady Blessington; falls into some
helpful legacies; keeps lazily by his legal practice;
husbands his resources, but never marries;
pounces upon every new lion of the day; hears
Coleridge lecture; hears Hazlitt lecture; hears
Erskine plead, and goes to play whist and drink
punch with the Lambs. He was full of anecdote,
and could talk by the hour. Rogers once
said to his guests who were prompt at breakfast:
“If you’ve anything to say, you’d better say it;
Crabb Robinson is coming.” He talked on all
subjects with average acuteness, and more than
average command of language, and little graceful
subtleties of social speech&mdash;but with no special
or penetrative analysis of his subject-matter. The
very type of a current, popular, well-received
man of the town&mdash;good at cards&mdash;good at a
club dinner&mdash;good at supper&mdash;good in travel&mdash;good
for a picnic&mdash;good for a lady’s tea-fight.</p>

<p>He must have written reams on reams of letters.
The big books of his <cite>Diary and Reminiscences</cite><a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
which I commend to you for their amusing and
most entertaining gossip, contained only a most
inconsiderable part of his written leavings.</p>

<p>He took admirable care of himself; did not
permit exposure to draughts&mdash;to indigestions, or
to bad company of any sort. Withal he was charitable&mdash;was
particular and fastidious; always
knew the best rulings of society about ceremony,
and always obeyed; never wore a dress-coat
counter to good form. He was an excellent listener&mdash;especially
to people of title; was a judicious
flatterer&mdash;a good friend and a good fellow;
dining out five days in the week, and living thus
till ninety: and if he had lived till now, I think
he would have died&mdash;dining out.</p>

<p>Mr. Robinson was not very strong in literary
criticism. I quote a bit from his <cite>Diary</cite>, that will
show, perhaps as well as any, his method and
range. It is dated <i>June 6, 1812</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Sent <cite>Peter Bell</cite> to Chas. Lamb. To my surprise, he
does not like it. He complains of the slowness of the narrative&mdash;as
if that were not the <em>art</em> of the poet. He says
Wordsworth has great thoughts, but has left them out here.
[And then continues in his own person.] In the perplexity
arising from the diverse judgments of those to whom I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
am accustomed to look up, I have no resource but in the
determination to disregard all opinions, and trust to the
simple impression made on my own mind. When Lady
Mackintosh was once stating to Coleridge her disregard of
the beauties of nature, which men commonly affect to admire,
he said his friend Wordsworth had described her feeling,
and quoted three lines from ‘<cite>Peter Bell</cite>:’</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘A primrose by a river brim</div>
<div class="verse">‘A yellow primrose was to him,</div>
<div class="verse">‘And it was nothing more.’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said Lady Mackintosh&mdash;‘that is precisely my
case.’”</p>

</div>

<h3>Thomas De Quincey.</h3>

<p>On the same page of that <cite>Diary</cite>&mdash;where I go
to verify this quotation&mdash;is this entry:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“At four o’clock dined in the [Temple] Hall with De
Quincey,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> who was very civil to me, and cordially invited me
to visit his cottage in Cumberland. Like myself, he is an
enthusiast for Wordsworth. His person is small, his complexion
fair, and his air and manner are those of a sickly
and enfeebled man.”<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Some twenty-seven years before the date of this
encounter, the sickly looking man was born near
to Manchester, his father being a well-to-do merchant
there&mdash;whose affairs took him often to
Portugal and Madeira, and whose invalidism kept
him there so much that the son scarce knew him;&mdash;remembers
only how his father came home one
day to his great country house&mdash;pale, and propped
up with pillows in the back of his carriage&mdash;came
to die. His mother, left with wealth enough for
herself and children, was of a stern Calvinistic
sort; which fact gives a streak of unpleasant color
here and there to the son’s reminiscences. He is
presently at odds with her about the Bath school&mdash;where
he is taught&mdash;she having moved into
Somersetshire, whereabout she knows Mistress
Hannah More; the boy comes to know this lady
too, with much reverence. The son is at odds with
his mother again about Eton (where, though
never a scholar, he has glimpses of George
III.&mdash;gets a little grunted talk even, from the
old king)&mdash;and is again at odds with the
mother about the Manchester Grammar School:
so much at odds here, that he takes the bit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
fairly in his mouth, and runs away with <cite>Euripides</cite>
in his pocket. Then he goes wandering
in Wales&mdash;gypsy-like&mdash;and from there strikes
across country blindly to London, where he becomes
gypsy indeed. He bargains with Jews to
advance money on his expectations: and with this
money for “sinker,” he sounds a depth of sin and
misery which we may guess at, by what we know,
but which in their fulness, even his galloping
pen never told. Into some of those depths his
friends traced him, and patched up a truce, which
landed him in Oxford.</p>

<p>Quiet and studious here at first&mdash;he is represented
as a rare talker, a little given to wine&mdash;writing
admiring letters to Wordsworth and others,
who were his gods in those days; falling
somehow into taste for that drug which for so
many years held him in its grip, body and
soul. The Oxford career being finished after a
sort, there are saunterings through London streets
again&mdash;evenings with the Lambs, with Godwin,
and excursions to Somersetshire and the Lake
country, where he encounters and gives nearer
worship to the poetic gods of his idolatry. Always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
shy, but earnest; most interesting to strangers&mdash;with
his pale face, high brow and lightning
glances; talking too with a winning flow and an
exuberance of epithet that somewhiles amounts to
brilliancy: no wonder he was tenderly entreated
by good Miss Wordsworth; no wonder the poet
of the “Doe of Rylstone” enjoyed the titillation
of such fresh, bright praises!</p>

<p>So De Quincey at twenty-four became householder
near to Grasmere&mdash;in the cottage I spoke
of in the opening of the chapter&mdash;once occupied
by Wordsworth, and later by Hartley Coleridge.
There, on that pretty shelf of the hills&mdash;scarce
lifted above Rydal-water, he gathers his books&mdash;studies
the mountains&mdash;provokes the gossip of
all the pretty Dalesmen’s daughters&mdash;lives there
a bachelor, eight years or more&mdash;ranging round
and round in bright autumnal days with the
sturdy John Wilson (of the <cite>Noctes Ambrosianæ</cite>)&mdash;cultivating
intimacy with poor crazy Lloyd
(who lived nearby)&mdash;studying all anomalous characters
with curious intensity, and finding anomalies
where others found none. Meantime and
through all, his sensibilities are kept wrought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
to fever heat by the opiate drinks&mdash;always flanking
him at his table; and he, so dreadfully wonted
to those devilish drafts, that&mdash;on some occasions&mdash;he
actually consumes within the twenty-four
hours the equivalent of seven full wine-glasses
of laudanum! No wonder the quiet Dales-people
looked dubiously at the light burning in those
cottage windows far into the gray of morning,
and counted the pale-faced, big-headed man for
something uncanny.</p>

<p>In these days comes about that strange episode
of his mad attachment to the little elfin child&mdash;Catharine
Wordsworth&mdash;of whom the poet-father
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent13">“Solitude to her</div>
<div class="verse">Was blithe society, who filled the air</div>
<div class="verse">With gladness and involuntary songs.</div>
<div class="verse">Light were her sallies, as the tripping fawn’s,</div>
<div class="verse">Forth startled from the form where she lay couched;</div>
<div class="verse">Unthought of, unexpected, as the stir</div>
<div class="verse">Of the soft breeze ruffling the meadow flowers.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yet De Quincey, arrogantly interpreting the
deep-seated affections of that father’s heart, says,
“She was no favorite with Wordsworth;” but he
“himself was blindly, doatingly, fascinated” by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
this child of three. And of her death, before she
is four, when De Quincey is on a visit in London,
he says, with crazy exaggeration:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Never, perhaps, from the foundations of those mighty
hills was there so fierce a convulsion of grief as mastered my
faculties on receiving that heart-shattering news.… I
had always viewed her as an impersonation of the dawn and
the spirit of infancy.… I returned hastily to Grasmere;
stretched myself every night, for more than two
months running, upon her grave; in fact often passed the
night upon her grave … in mere intensity of sick,
frantic yearning after neighborhood to the darling of my
heart.”<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This is a type of his ways of feeling, and of his
living, and of his speech&mdash;tending easily to all
manner of extravagance: black and white are too
tame for his nerve-exaltation; if a friend looks
sharply, “his eye glares;” if disturbed, he has a
“tumult of the brain;” if he doubles his fist, his
gestures are the wildest; and a well-built son and
daughter of a neighbor Dalesman are the images
of “Coriolanus and Valeria.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<h3>Marriage and other Flights.</h3>

<p>At thirty-one, or thereabout, De Quincey married
the honest daughter of an honest yeoman of
the neighborhood. She was sensible (except her
marriage invalidate the term), was kindly, was
long-suffering, and yet was very human. I suspect
the interior of that cottage was not always
like the islands of the blessed. Mr. Froude would
perhaps have enjoyed lifting the roof from such a
house. Many children were born to that strangely
coupled pair,&mdash;some of them still living and most
worthy.</p>

<p>It happens by and by to this impractical man,
from whose disorderly and always open hand inherited
moneys have slipped away; it happens&mdash;I
say&mdash;that he must earn his bread by his own
toil; so he projects great works of philosophy, of
political economy, which are to revolutionize opinions;
but they topple over into opium dreams before
they are realized. He tries editing a county
paper, but it is nought. At last he utilizes even
his vices, and a chapter of the <cite>Confessions of an
Opium Eater</cite>, in the <cite>London Magazine</cite>, draws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
swift attention to one whose language is as vivid
as a flame; and he lays bare, without qualm, his
own quivering sensibilities. This spurt of work,
or some new craze, takes him to London, away
from his family. And so on a sudden, that idyl
of life among the Lakes becomes for many years
a tattered and blurred page to him. He is once
more a denizen of the great city, living a shy, hermit
existence there; long time in a dim back-room
of the publisher Bohn’s, in Bedford Street,
near to Covent Garden. He sees Proctor and
Hazlitt odd-whiles, and Hood, and still more of
the Lambs; but he is peevish and distant, and
finds largest company in the jug of laudanum
which brings swift succeeding dreams and stupefaction.</p>

<p>We will have a taste of some of his wild writing
of those days. He is speaking of a dream.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The dream commenced with a music of preparation and
of awakening suspense; a music like the opening of the Coronation
Anthem, and which, like that, gave the feeling of a
vast march; of infinite cavalcades filing off, and the tread
of innumerable armies. The morning was come of a mighty
day, a day of crisis and of final hope for human nature, then
suffering some mysterious eclipse, and laboring in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
dread extremity. Somewhere, I knew not where&mdash;somehow, I
knew not how&mdash;by some beings, I knew not whom&mdash;a battle,
a strife, an agony was conducting, was evolving like a great
drama or a piece of music.… I had the power, and
yet had not the power to decide it … for the weight of
twenty Atlantes was upon me as the oppression of inexpiable
guilt. Deeper than ever plummet sounded, I lay inactive.
Then, like a chorus, the passion deepened; there came sudden
alarms, hurrying to and fro, trepidations of innumerable
fugitives, I know not whether from the good cause or the
bad; darkness and lights; tempest and human faces; and at
last, with the sense that all was lost, female forms, and the
features that were worth all the world to me, and but a moment
allowed&mdash;and clasped hands and heart-breaking partings,
and then everlasting farewells! and with a sigh such as
the caves of hell sighed when the incestuous mother uttered
the abhorred name of Death, the sound was reverberated&mdash;everlasting
farewells! and again, and yet again reverberated&mdash;everlasting
farewells!”</p>

</div>

<p>Some years later he drifts again to Grasmere,
but only to pluck up root and branch that home
with wife and children,&mdash;so wonted now to the
pleasant sounds and sights of the Lake waters and
the mountains&mdash;and to transport them to Edinboro’,
where, through Professor Wilson, he has
promise of work which had begun to fail him in
London.</p>

<p>There,&mdash;though he has the introduction which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
a place at the tavern table of Father Ambrose
gives&mdash;he is a lonely man; pacing solitary, sometimes
in the shadow of the Castle Rock, sometimes
in the shadow of the old houses of the
Canongate; always preoccupied, close-lipped,
brooding, and never without that wretched opium-comforter
at his home. It was in <cite>Blackwood</cite>
(1827) he first published the well known essay on
“Murder as a Fine Art,”&mdash;perhaps the best known
of all he wrote; there, too, he committed to
paper, in the stress of his necessities, those sketchy
<cite>Reminiscences</cite> of his Lake life; loose, disjointed,
ill-considered, often sent to press without any revision
and full of strange coined words. I note
at random, such as <em>novel-ish erector</em> (for builder),
<em>lambencies</em>, <em>apricating</em>, <em>aculeated</em>; using words
not rarely, etymologically, and for some recondite
sense attaching. Worse than this, there is dreary
tittle-tattle and a pulling away of decent domestic
drapery from the lives of those he had professed to
love and honor; tedious expatiation, too, upon the
scandal-mongering of servant-maids, with illustrations
by page on page; and yet, for the matter of
gossip, he is himself as fertile as a seamstress or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
monthly nurse, and as overflowing and brazen as
any newspaper you may name.</p>

<p>But here and there, even amid his dreariest
pages, you see, quivering&mdash;some gleams of his
old strange power&mdash;a thrust of keen thought
that bewilders you by its penetration&mdash;a glowing
fancy that translates one to wondrous heights of
poetic vision; and oftener yet, and over and over,
shows that mastery of the finesse of language by
which he commands the most attenuated reaches
of his thought, and whips them into place with
a snap and a sting.</p>

<p>Yet, when all is said, I think we must count
the best that he wrote only amongst the curiosities
of literature, rather than with the manna
that fell for fainting souls in the wilderness.</p>

<p>De Quincey died in Edinburgh, in 1859, aged
seventy-four.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">In our last chapter we took a breezy morning
walk amid the Lake scenery of England&mdash;more
particularly that portion of it which lies
between the old homes of Wordsworth and of
Southey; we found it a thirteen-mile stretch of
road, coiling along narrow meadows and over gray
heights&mdash;beside mountains and mountain tarns&mdash;with
Helvellyn lifting mid-way and Skiddaw
towering at the end. We had our talk of Dr.
Southey&mdash;so brave at his work&mdash;so generous in
his home charities&mdash;so stiff in his Churchism
and latter-day Toryism&mdash;with a very keen eye
for beauty; yet writing poems&mdash;stately and
masterful&mdash;which long ago went to the top-shelves,
and stay there.</p>

<p>We had our rough and ready interviews with
that first of “War Correspondents”&mdash;Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Crabb Robinson&mdash;who knew all the prominent
men of this epoch, and has given us such entertaining
chit-chat about them, as we all listen
to, and straightway forget. Afterwards we had
a look at that strange, intellectual, disorderly
creature De Quincey&mdash;he living a long while in
the Lake Country&mdash;and in his more inspired
moments seeming to carry us by his swift words,
into that mystical region lying beyond the borders
of what we know and see. He swayed men; but
he rarely taught them, or fed them.</p>

<h3>Christopher North.</h3>

<p>We still linger about those charmingest of
country places; and by a wooden gateway&mdash;adjoining
the approach to Windermere Hotel&mdash;upon
the “Elleray woods,” amid which
lived&mdash;eighty years ago&mdash;that stalwart friend of
De Quincey’s, whose acquaintance he made among
the Lakes, and who, like himself, was a devoted
admirer of Wordsworth. Indeed, I think it was
at the home of the latter that De Quincey first
encountered the tall, lusty John Wilson&mdash;brimful
of enthusiasm and all country ardors; brimful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
too, of gush, and all poetic undulations of speech.
He<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> was a native of Paisley&mdash;his father having
been a rich manufacturer there&mdash;and had come to
spend his abundant enthusiasms and his equally
abundant moneys between Wordsworth and the
mountains and Windermere. He has his fleet
of yachts and barges upon the lake; he knows
every pool where any trout lurk&mdash;every height
that gives far-off views. He is a pugilist, a
swimmer, an oarsman&mdash;making the hills echo
with his jollity, and dashing off through the
springy heather with that slight, seemingly frail
De Quincey in his wake&mdash;who only reaches to his
shoulder, but who is all compact of nerve and
muscle. For Greek they are fairly mated, both
by love and learning; and they can and do chant
together the choral songs of heathen tragedies.</p>

<p>This yellow-haired, blue-eyed giant, John Wilson&mdash;not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
so well-known now as he was sixty years
ago&mdash;we collegians greatly admired in that far-off
day. He had written the <cite>Isle of Palms</cite>, and was
responsible for much of the wit and dash and
merriment which sparkled over the early pages
of <cite>Blackwood’s Magazine</cite>&mdash;in the chapters of the
<cite>Noctes Ambrosianæ</cite> and in many a paper besides:&mdash;he
had his first university training at Glasgow;
had a brief love-episode there also, which makes
a prettily coy appearance on the pleasant pages
of the biography of Wilson which a daughter
(Mrs. Gordon) has compiled. After Glasgow came
Oxford; and a characteristic bit of his later writing,
which I cite, will show you how Oxford impressed
him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Having bidden farewell to our sweet native Scotland,
and kissed ere we parted, the grass and the flowers with a
show of filial tears&mdash;having bidden farewell to all her glens,
now a-glimmer in the blended light of imagination and
memory, with their cairns and kirks, their low-chimneyed
huts, and their high-turreted halls, their free-flowing rivers,
and lochs dashing like seas&mdash;we were all at once buried not
in the Cimmerian gloom, but the Cerulean glitter of Oxford’s
Ancient Academic groves. The genius of the place fell upon
us. Yes! we hear now, in the renewed delight of the awe of
our youthful spirit, the pealing organ in that Chapel called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the Beautiful; we see the Saints on the stained windows; at
the Altar the picture of One up Calvary meekly ascending.
It seemed then that our hearts had no need even of the kindness
of kindred&mdash;of the country where we were born, and
that had received the continued blessings of our enlarging
love! Yet away went, even then, sometimes, our thoughts
to Scotland, like carrier-pigeons wafting love messages beneath
their unwearied wings.”<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

</div>

<p>We should count this, and justly, rather over-fine
writing nowadays. Yet it is throughout
stamped with the peculiarities of Christopher
North; he cannot help his delightfully wanton
play with language and sentiment; and into whatever
sea of topics he plunged&mdash;early or late in
life&mdash;he always came up glittering with the beads
and sparkles of a highly charged rhetoric. Close
after Oxford comes that idyllic life<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> in Windermere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
to which I have referred. Four or more
years pass there; his trees grow there; his new
roads&mdash;hewn through the forests&mdash;wind there;
he plots a new house there; he climbs the mountains;
he is busy with his boats. Somewhat later
he marries; he does not lose his old love for the
poets of the Greek anthology; he has children
born to him; he breeds game fowls, and looks
after them as closely as a New England farmer’s
wife after her poultry; but with him poetry and
poultry go together. There are old diaries of his&mdash;into
which his daughter gives us a peep&mdash;that
show such entries as this:&mdash;“The small Paisley
hen set herself 6th of July, with no fewer than
nine eggs;” and again&mdash;“Red pullet in Josie’s
barn was set with eight eggs on Thursday;” and
square against such memoranda, and in script as
careful, will appear some bit of verse like this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Oh, fairy child! what can I wish for thee?</div>
<div class="verse">Like a perennial flowret may’st thou be,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
<div class="verse">That spends its life in beauty and in bliss;</div>
<div class="verse">Soft on thee fall the breath of time,</div>
<div class="verse">And still retain in heavenly clime</div>
<div class="verse">The bloom that charms in this.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He wrote, too, while living there above Windermere,
his poem of the <cite>Isle of Palms</cite>; having a
fair success in the early quarter of this century,
but which was quickly put out of sight and hearing
by the brisker, martial music of Scott, and by
the later and more vigorous and resonant verse of
Byron.</p>

<p>Indeed, Wilson’s poetry was not such as we
would have looked for from one who was a
“varra bad un to lick” at a wrestling bout,
and who made the splinters fly when his bludgeon
went thwacking into a page of controversial prose.
His verse is tender; it is graceful; it is delicate;
it is full of languors too; and it is tiresome&mdash;a
gentle girlish treble of sound it has, that you can
hardly associate with this brawny mass of manhood.</p>

<h3>Wilson in Scotland.</h3>

<p>But all that delightful life amidst the woods of
Elleray&mdash;with its game-cocks, and boats, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
mountain rambles, and shouted chorus of Prometheus&mdash;comes
to a sharp end. The inherited
fortune of the poet, by some criminal carelessness
or knavery of a relative, goes in a day; and
our fine stalwart wrestler must go to Edinboro’
to wrestle with the fates. There he coquets
for a time with law; but presently falls into
pleasant affiliation with old Mr. Blackwood (who
was a remarkable man in his way) in the conduct
of his magazine. And then came the trumpet
blasts of mingled wit, bravado, and tenderness,
which broke into those pages, and which made
young college men in England or Scotland or
America, fling up their hats for Christopher
North. Not altogether a safe guide, I think,
as a rhetorician; too much bounce in him; too
little self-restraint; too much of glitter and iridescence;
but, on the other hand&mdash;bating some
blackguardism&mdash;he is brimful of life and heartiness
and merriment&mdash;lighted up with scholarly
hues of color.</p>

<p>There was associated with Wilson in those days,
in work upon <cite>Blackwood</cite>, a young man&mdash;whom
we may possibly not have occasion to speak of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
again, and yet who is worthy of mention. I mean
J. G. Lockhart,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> who afterwards became son-in-law
and the biographer of Walter Scott&mdash;a slight
young fellow in that day, very erect and prim;
wearing his hat well forward on his heavy brows,
and so shading a face that was thin, clean cut,
handsome, and which had almost the darkness
of a Spaniard’s. He put his rapier-like thrusts
into a good many papers which the two wrought
at together. All his life he loved literary digs
with his stiletto&mdash;which was very sharp&mdash;and
when he left Edinboro’ to edit the <cite>Quarterly
Review</cite> in London (as he did in after days) he
took his stiletto with him. There are scenes in
that unevenly written Lockhart story of <cite>Adam
Blair</cite>&mdash;hardly known now&mdash;which for thrilling
passion, blazing out of clear sufficiencies of
occasion, would compare well with kindred scenes
of Scott’s own, and which score deeper colorings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of human woe and loves and remorse than belong
to most modern stories; not lighted, indeed, with
humor; not entertaining with anecdote; not embroidered
with archæologic knowledge; not rattling
with coruscating social fireworks, but&mdash;subtle,
psychologic, touching the very marrow of
our common manhood with a pen both sharp and
fine. We remember him, however, most gratefully
as the charming biographer of Scott, and as the
accomplished translator of certain Spanish ballads
into which he has put&mdash;under flowing English
verse&mdash;all the clashing of Cordovan castanets,
and all the jingle of the war stirrups of the Moors.</p>

<p>We return now to Professor Wilson and propose
to tell you how he came by that title. It was
after only a few years of work in connection
with <cite>Blackwood</cite> that the Chair of Moral Philosophy
in Edinboro’ University&mdash;which had been
held by Dugald Stewart, and later by Dr. Thomas
Brown&mdash;fell vacant; and at once the name of
Wilson was pressed by his friends for the position.
It was not a little odd that a man best known by
two delicate poems, and by a bold swashbuckler
sort of magazine writing should be put forward&mdash;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
such a staid city as Edinboro’, and against
such a candidate as Sir William Hamilton&mdash;for a
Chair which had been held by Dugald Stewart!
But he <em>was</em> so put forward, and successfully;
Walter Scott and the Government coming to his
aid. Upon this, he went resolutely to study in
the new line marked out for him; his rods and
guns were, for the time, hung upon the wall; his
wrestling frolics and bouts at quarter-staff, and
suppers at the Ambrose tavern, were laid under
limitations. He put a conscience and a pertinacity
into his labor that he had never put to any
intellectual work before.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> But there were very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
many people in Edinboro’ who had been aggrieved
by the appointment&mdash;largely, too, among those
from whom his pupils would come. There was,
naturally, great anxiety among his friends respecting
the opening of the first session. An
eye-witness says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I went prepared to join in a cabal which was formed to
put him down. The lecture-room was crowded to the ceiling.
Such a collection of hard-browed, scowling Scotsmen,
muttering over their knob-sticks, I never saw. The Professor
entered with a bold step, amid profound silence.
Every one expected some deprecatory, or propitiatory introduction
of himself and his subject, upon which the mass was
to decide against him, reason or no reason; but he began
with a voice of thunder right into the matter of his lecture,
kept up&mdash;unflinchingly and unhesitatingly, without a pause&mdash;a
flow of rhetoric such as Dugald Stewart or Dr. Brown, his
predecessors, never delivered in the same place. Not a
word&mdash;not a murmur escaped his captivated audience; and
at the end they gave him a right-down unanimous burst of
applause.”<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

</div>

<p>From that time forth, for thirty years or more,
John Wilson held the place, and won a popularity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
with his annual relays of pupils that was unexampled
and unshaken. Better lectures in his
province may very possibly have been written by
others elsewhere&mdash;more close, more compact,
more thoroughly thought out, more methodic.
His were not patterned after Reid and Stewart;
indeed, not patterned at all; not wrought into a
burnished system, with the pivots and cranks of
the old school-men all in their places. But
they made up a series&mdash;continuous, and lapping
each into each, by easy confluence of topic&mdash;of
discourses on moral duties and on moral relations,
with full and brilliant illustrative talk&mdash;sometimes
in his heated moments taking on the gush
and exuberance of a poem; other times bristling
with reminiscences; yet full of suggestiveness,
and telling as much, I think, on the minds of his
eager and receptive students as if the rhetorical
brilliancies had all been plucked away, and some
master of a duller craft had reduced his words to a
stiff, logical paradigm.</p>

<p>From this time forward Professor Wilson lived
a quiet, domestic, yet fully occupied life. He
wrote enormously for the magazine with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
his name had become identified; there is scarce a
break in his thirty years’ teachings in the university;
there are sometimes brief interludes of travel;
journeys to London; flights to the Highlands;
there are breaks in his domestic circle, breaks in
the larger circle of his friends; there are twinges
of the gout and there come wrinkles of age; but
he is braver to resist than most; and for years on
years everybody knew that great gaunt figure, with
blue eyes and hair flying wild, striding along Edinboro’
streets.</p>

<p>His poems have indeed almost gone down under
the literary horizon of to-day; but one who has
known <cite>Blackwood</cite> of old, can hardly wander anywhere
amongst the Highlands of Scotland without
pleasant recollections of Christopher North and of
the musical bravuras of his speech.</p>

<h3>Thomas Campbell.</h3>

<p>Another Scotsman, who is worthy of our attention
for a little time, is one of a different order;
he is stiff, he is prim, he is almost priggish; he is
so in his young days and he keeps so to the very
last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>A verse or two from one of the little poems he
wrote will bring him to your memory:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“On Linden when the sun was low,</div>
<div class="verse">All bloodless lay the untrodden snow,</div>
<div class="verse">And dark as winter was the flow,</div>
<div class="verse">Of Iser, rolling rapidly.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And again:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Then shook the hills with thunder riven,</div>
<div class="verse">Then rushed the steed to battle driven,</div>
<div class="verse">And louder than the bolts of heaven,</div>
<div class="verse">Far flashed the red artillery.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If Thomas Campbell<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> had never written anything
more than that page-long story of the
“Battle of Hohenlinden,” his name would have
gone into all the anthologies, and his verse into all
those school-books where boys for seventy years
now have pounded at his martial metre in furies of
declamation. And yet this bit of martial verse, so
full of the breath of battle, was, at the date of its
writing, rejected by the editor of a small provincial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
journal in Scotland&mdash;as not coming up to the
true poetic standard!<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>I have spoken of Campbell as a Scotsman;
though after only a short stay in Scotland&mdash;following
his university career at Glasgow&mdash;and a
starveling tour upon the Continent (out of which
flashed “Hohenlinden”)&mdash;he went to London;
and there or thereabout spent the greater part of
the residue of a long life. He had affiliations of
a certain sort with America, out of which may
possibly have grown his <cite>Gertrude of Wyoming</cite>;
his father was for much time a merchant in Falmouth,
Virginia, about 1770; being however a
strong loyalist, he returned in 1776. A brother
and an uncle of the poet became established in
this country, and an American Campbell of this
stock was connected by marriage with the family
of Patrick Henry.</p>

<p>The first <i lang="fr">coup</i> by which Campbell won his literary
spurs, was a bright, polished poem&mdash;with its
couplets all in martinet-like order&mdash;called the
<cite>Pleasures of Hope</cite>. We all know it, if for nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
more, by reason of the sympathetic allusion
to the woes of Poland:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Ah, bloodiest picture in the book of time!</div>
<div class="verse">Sarmatia fell, unwept, without a crime;</div>
<div class="verse">Found not a generous friend, a pitying foe,</div>
<div class="verse">Strength in her arms nor mercy in her woe!</div>
<div class="verse">Dropped from her nerveless grasp the shattered spear,</div>
<div class="verse">Closed her bright eye and curbed her high career,</div>
<div class="verse">Hope for a season bade the world farewell,</div>
<div class="verse">And freedom shrieked as Kosciusko fell!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Even at so late a date as the death of Campbell
(1844), when they buried him in Westminster Abbey,
close upon the tomb of Sheridan, some grateful
Pole secured a handful of earth from the grave
of Kosciusko to throw upon the coffin of the poet.</p>

<p>But in addition to its glow of liberalism, this
first poem of Campbell was, measured by all the
old canons of verse, thoroughly artistic. Its
pauses, its rhymes, its longs and shorts were of the
best prize order; even its errors in matters of fact
have an academic tinge&mdash;as, for instance,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“On Erie’s banks, where tigers steal along!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The truth is, Mr. Campbell was never strong in
his natural history; he does not scruple to put
flamingoes and palm trees into the valley of Wyoming.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Another reason why the first poem of
Campbell’s, written when he was only twenty-one,
came to such success, was the comparatively clear
field it had. The date of publication was at the
end of the century. Byron was in his boyhood;
Scott had not published his <cite>Lay of the Last
Minstrel</cite> (1805); Southey had printed only his
<cite>Joan of Arc</cite> (1796), which few people read; the
same may be said of Landor’s <cite>Gebir</cite>, (1797);
Cowper was an old story; Rogers’s <cite>Pleasures of
Memory</cite> (1792), and Moore’s translation of
<cite>Anacreon</cite> (1799-1800), were the more current
things with which people who loved fresh poetry
could regale themselves. The <cite>Lyrical Ballads</cite> of
Wordsworth and Coleridge had indeed been
printed, perhaps a year or two before, down in
Bristol; but scarce any one read <em>these</em>; few bought
them;<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and yet&mdash;in that copy of the <cite>Lyrical
Ballads</cite> was lying <i lang="fr">perdu</i>&mdash;almost unknown and
uncared for&mdash;the “Rime of the Ancient Mariner.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p><cite>Gertrude of Wyoming</cite>, a poem, written at
Sydenham, near London, about 1807, and which,
sixty years ago, every good American who was
collecting books thought it necessary to place upon
his shelves, I rarely find there now. It has not the
rhetorical elaboration of Campbell’s first poem;
never won its success; there are bits of war in it,
and of massacre, that are gorgeously encrimsoned,
and which are laced through and through with
sounds of fife and warwhoop; but the landscape
is a disorderly exaggeration (I have already hinted
at its palm trees) and its love-tale has only the
ardors of a stage scene in it; we know where the
tragedy is coming in, and gather up our wraps so
as to be ready when the curtain falls.</p>

<p>He was a born actor&mdash;in need (for his best
work) of the foot-lights, the on-lookers, the trombone,
the bass-drum. He never glided into victories
of the pen by natural inevitable movement
of brain or heart; he stopped always and everywhere
to consider his <em>pose</em>.</p>

<p>There is little of interest in Campbell’s personal
history; he married a cousin; lived, as I said,
mostly in London, or its immediate neighborhood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
He had two sons&mdash;one dying young, and the
other of weak mind&mdash;lingering many years&mdash;a
great grief and source of anxiety to his father, who
had the reputation of being exacting and stern in
his family. He edited for a long time the <cite>New
Monthly Magazine</cite>, and wrote much for it, but
is represented to have been, in its conduct, careless,
hypercritical, and dilatory. He lectured, too,
before the Royal Institute on poetry; read oratorically
and showily&mdash;his subject matter being
semi-philosophical, with a great air of learning
and academically dry; there was excellent system
in his discourses, and careful thinking on themes
remote from most people’s thought. He wrote
some historical works which are not printed nowadays;
his life of Mrs. Siddons is bad; his life of
Petrarch is but little better; some poems he published
late in life are quite unworthy of him and
are never read. Nevertheless, this prim, captious
gentleman wrote many things which have the
ring of truest poetry and which will be dear to
the heart of England as long as English ships sail
forth to battle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<h3>A Minstrel of the Border.</h3>

<p>Yet another Scotsman whose name will not be
forgotten&mdash;whether British ships go to battle, or
idle at the docks&mdash;is Walter Scott.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> I scarce
know how to begin to speak of him. We all
know him so well&mdash;thanks to the biography
of his son-in-law, Lockhart, which is almost
Boswellian in its minuteness, and has dignity
besides. We know&mdash;as we know about a neighbor’s
child&mdash;of his first struggles with illness,
wrapped in a fresh sheepskin, upon the heathery
hills by Smailholme Tower; we know of the strong,
alert boyhood that succeeded; he following, with
a firm seat and free rein&mdash;amongst other game&mdash;the
old wives’ tales and border ballads which,
thrumming in his receptive ears, put the Edinboro
law studies into large confusion. Swift
after this comes the hurry-scurry of a boyish love-chase&mdash;beginning
in Grey Friar’s church-yard;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
she, however, who sprung the race&mdash;presently
doubles upon him, and is seen no more; and he
goes lumbering forward to another fate. It was
close upon these experiences that some friends of
his printed privately his ballad of <cite>William and
Helen</cite>, founded on the German Lenore:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Tramp, tramp! along the land they rode!</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Splash, splash! along the sea!</div>
<div class="verse">The scourge is red, the spur drops blood,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">The flashing pebbles flee!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And the spirit and dash of those four lines
were quickly recognized as marking a new power
in Scotch letters; and an echo of them, or of their
spirit, in some shape or other, may be found, I
think, in all his succeeding poems and in all the
tumults and struggles of his life. The elder Scott
does not like this philandering with rhyme; it will
spoil the law, and a solid profession, he thinks;
and true enough it does. For the <cite>Border Minstrelsy</cite>
comes spinning its delightfully musical and
tender stories shortly after Lenore; and a little
later appears his first long poem&mdash;the <cite>Lay
of the Last Minstrel</cite>&mdash;which waked all Scotland

He was thirty-four then; ripening later
than Campbell, who at twenty-one had published
his <cite>Pleasures of Hope</cite>. There was no kinship in
the methods of the two poets; Campbell all precision,
and nice balance, delicate adjustment of
language&mdash;stepping from point to point in his
progress with all grammatic precautions and with
well-poised poetic steps and demi-volts, as studied
as a dancing master’s; while Scott dashed to his
purpose with a seeming abandonment of care, and
a swift pace that made the “pebbles fly.” Just
as unlike, too, was this racing freedom of Scott’s&mdash;which
dragged the mists away from the Highlands,
and splashed his colors of gray, and of the
purple of blooming heather over the moors&mdash;from
that other strain of verse, with its introspections
and deeper folded charms, which in the hands of
Wordsworth was beginning to declare itself humbly
and coyly, but as yet with only the rarest applause.
I cannot make this distinction clearer
than by quoting a little landscape picture&mdash;let
us say from <cite>Marmion</cite>&mdash;and contrasting with it
another from Wordsworth, which was composed six
years or more before <cite>Marmion</cite> was published.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
First, then, from Scott&mdash;and nothing prettier and
quieter of rural sort belongs to him,&mdash;</p>

<p>This will emphasize the distinction, to which I
would call attention, in the treatment of landscape
by the two poets: Wordsworth putting <em>his</em>
all on a simmer with humanities and far-reaching
meditative hopes and languors; and Scott
throwing windows wide open to the sky, and saying
only&mdash;look&mdash;and be glad!</p>

<p>In those days Wordsworth had one reader where
Scott had a hundred; and the one reader was apologetic
and shy, and the hundred were loud and
gushing. I think the number of their respective
readers is more evenly balanced nowadays; and
it is the readers of Scott who are beginning to be
apologetic. Indeed I have a half consciousness of
putting myself on this page in that category:&mdash;As
if the Homeric toss and life and play, and large
sweep of rivers, and of battalions and winnowed
love-notes, and clang of trumpets, and moaning of
the sea, which rise and fall in the pages of the
<cite>Minstrel</cite> and of <cite>Marmion</cite>&mdash;needed apology!
Apology or no, I think Scott’s poems will be read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
for a good many years to come. The guide books
and Highland travellers&mdash;and high-thoughted
travellers&mdash;will keep them alive&mdash;if the critics
do not; and I think you will find no better fore-reading
for a trip along the Tweed or through
the Trosachs than <cite>Marmion</cite>, and the <cite>Lady of
the Lake</cite>.</p>

<h3>The Waverley Dispensation.</h3>

<p>Meantime, our author has married&mdash;a marriage,
Goldwin Smith says, of “intellectual disparagement”;
which I suppose means that Mrs.
Scott was not learned and bookish&mdash;as she certainly
was not; but she was honest, true-hearted,
and domestic. Mr. Redding profanely says that
she was used to plead, “Walter, my dear, you
must write a new book, for I want another silk
dress.” I think this is apocryphal; and there is
good reason to believe that she gave a little hearty
home huzza at each one of Mr. Scott’s quick
succeeding triumphs.</p>

<p>Our author has also changed his home; first
from the pretty little village of Lasswade, which is
down by Dalkeith, to Ashestiel by the Yarrow;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and thence again to a farm-house, near to that unfortunate
pile of Abbotsford, which stands on the
Tweed bank, shadowed by the trees he planted,
and shadowed yet more heavily by the story of his
misfortunes. I notice a disposition in some recent
writers to disparage this notable country home as
pseudo-Gothic and flimsy. This gives a false impression
of a structure which, though it lack that
singleness of expression and subordination of
details which satisfy a professional critic, does
yet embody in a singularly interesting way, and
with solid construction, all the aspirations, tastes,
clannish vanities and archæologic whims of the
great novelist. The castellated tower is there to
carry the Scottish standard, and the cloister to
keep alive reverent memory of old religious
houses; and the miniature Court gate, with its
warder’s horn; and the Oriole windows, whose details
are, maybe, snatched from Kenilworth; the
mass, too, is impressive and smacks all over of
Scott’s personality and of the traditions he cherished.</p>

<p>I am tempted to introduce here some notes of a
visit made to this locality very many years ago. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
had set off on a foot-pilgrimage from the old
border town of Berwick-on-Tweed; had kept
close along the banks of the river, seeing men
drawing nets for salmon, whose silvery scales
flashed in the morning sun. All around swept
those charming fields of Tweed-side, green with the
richest June growth; here and there were shepherds
at their sheep washing; old Norham Castle
presently lifted its gray buttresses into view; then
came the long Coldstream bridge, with its arches
shimmering in the flood below; and after this the
palace of the Duke of Roxburgh. In thus following
up leisurely the Tweed banks from Berwick,
I had slept the first night at Kelso; had studied
the great fine bit of ruin which is there, and had
caught glimpses of Teviot-dale and of the Eildon
Hills; had wandered out of my way for a sight of
Smailholme tower, and of Sandy Knowe&mdash;both
associated with Scott’s childhood; I passed Dryburgh,
where he lies buried, and at last on an
evening of early June, 1845, a stout oarsman ferried
me across the Tweed and landed me in Melrose.</p>

<p>I slept at the George Inn&mdash;dreaming (as many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
a young wayfarer in those lands has since done),
of Ivanhoe and Rebecca, and border wars and <cite>Old
Mortality</cite>. Next morning, after a breakfast upon
trout taken from some near stream (very likely the
Yarrow or the Gala-water), I strolled two miles or
so along the road which followed the Tweed bank
upon the southern side, and by a green foot-gate
entered the Abbotsford grounds. The forest trees&mdash;not
over high at that time&mdash;were those which the
master had planted. From his favorite outdoor
seat, sheltered by a thicket of arbor-vitæ, could
be caught a glimpse of the rippled surface of the
Tweed and of the turrets of the house.</p>

<p>It was all very quiet&mdash;quiet in the wood-walks;
quiet as you approached the court-yard; the master
dead; the family gone; I think there was a yelp
from some young hound in an out-building, and
a twitter from some birds I did not know; there
was the unceasing murmur of the river. Besides
these sounds, the silence was unbroken; and when
I rang the bell at the entrance door, the jangle of
it was very startling; startling a little terrier, too,
whose quick, sharp bark rang noisily through the
outer court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Only an old house-keeper was in charge, who
had fallen into that dreadful parrot-like way of
telling visitors what things were best worth seeing&mdash;which
frets one terribly. What should you or I
care (fresh from <cite>Guy Mannering</cite> or <cite>Kenilworth</cite>)
whether a bit of carving came from Jedburgh or
Kelso? or about the jets in the chandelier, or the
way in which a Russian Grand Duke wrote his
name in the visitors’ book?</p>

<p>But when we catch sight of the desk at which
the master wrote, or of the chair in which he sat,
and of his shoes and coat and cane&mdash;looking as
if they might have been worn yesterday&mdash;these
seem to bring us nearer to the man who has
written so much to cheer and to charm the world.
There was, too, a little box in the corridor, simple
and iron-bound, with the line written below it,
“Post will close at two.” It was as if we had
heard the master of the house say it. Perhaps
the notice was in his handwriting (he had been
active there in 1831-2&mdash;just thirteen years before)&mdash;perhaps
not; but&mdash;somehow&mdash;more than the
library, or the portrait bust, or the chatter of the
well-meaning house-keeper, it brought back the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
halting old gentleman in his shooting-coat, and
with ivory-headed cane&mdash;hobbling with a vigorous
step along the corridor, to post in that iron-bound
box a packet&mdash;maybe a chapter of <cite>Woodstock</cite>.</p>

<p>I have spoken of the vacant house&mdash;family
gone: The young Sir Walter Scott, of the British
army, and heir to the estate&mdash;was at that date
(1845) absent in the Indies; and only two years
thereafter died at sea on his voyage home.
Charles Scott, the only brother of the younger Sir
Walter, died in 1841.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Miss Anne Scott, the only
unmarried daughter of the author of <cite>Waverley</cite>,
died&mdash;worn-out with tenderest care of mother and
father, and broken-hearted&mdash;in 1833. Her only
sister, Mrs. (Sophia Scott) Lockhart, died in 1837.
Her oldest son&mdash;John Hugh, familiarly known as
“Hugh Little John”&mdash;the crippled boy, for
whom had been written the <cite>Tales of a Grandfather</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and the darling of the two households upon
Tweed-side&mdash;died in 1831. I cannot forbear
quoting here a charming little memorial of him,
which, within the present year, has appeared in
Mr. Lang’s <cite>Life of Lockhart</cite>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A figure as of one of Charles Lamb’s dream-children
haunts the little beck at Chiefswood, and on that haugh at
Abbotsford, where Lockhart read the manuscript of the
<cite>Fortunes of Nigel</cite>, fancy may see ‘Hugh Little John,’
‘throwing stones into the burn,’ for so he called the Tweed.
While children study the <cite>Tales of a Grandfather</cite>, he does
not want friends in this world to remember and envy the
boy who had Sir Walter to tell him stories.”&mdash;P. 75,
vol. ii.</p>

</div>

<p>A younger son of Lockhart, Walter Scott by
name, became, at the death of the younger Walter
Scott, inheritor of all equities in the landed estate
upon Tweed-side, and the proper Laird of Abbotsford.
His story is a short and a sad one; he was
utterly unworthy, and died almost unbefriended
at Versailles in January, 1853.</p>

<p>His father, J. G. Lockhart, acknowledging a
picture of this son, under date of 1843, in a letter
addressed to his daughter Charlotte&mdash;(later Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Hope-Scott,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and mother of the present proprietress
of Abbotsford), writes with a grief he
could not cover:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am not sorry to have it by me, though it breaks my
heart to recall the date. It is of the sweet, innocent, happy
boy, home for Sunday from Cowies [his school].… Oh,
God! how soon that day became clouded, and how dark its
early close! Well, I suppose there is another world; if not,
sure this is a blunder.”</p>

</div>

<p>I have not spoken&mdash;because there seemed no
need to speak&mdash;of the way in which those marvellous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
romantic fictions of Sir Walter came
pouring from the pen, under a cloud of mystery,
and of how the great burden of his business
embarrassments&mdash;due largely to the recklessness
of his jolly, easy-going friends, the Ballantynes&mdash;overwhelmed
him at last. Indeed, in all I
have ventured to say of Scott, I have a feeling
of its impertinence&mdash;as if I were telling you about
your next-door neighbor: we all know that swift,
brilliant, clouded career so well! But are those
novels of his to live, and to delight coming
generations, as they have the past? I do not
know what the very latest critics may have to
say; but, for my own part, I have strong belief
that a century or two more will be sure to pass
over before people of discernment, and large
humanities, and of literary appreciation, will
cease to read and to enjoy such stories as that
of the <cite>Talisman of Kenilworth</cite> and of <cite>Old Mortality</cite>.
I know ’tis objected, and with much
reason, that he wrote hastily, carelessly&mdash;that
his stories are in fact (what Carlyle called them)
extemporaneous stories. Yet, if they had been
written under other conditions, could we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
counted upon the heat and the glow which gives
them illumination?</p>

<p>No, no&mdash;we do not go to him for word-craft;
men of shorter imaginative range, and whose
judgments wait on conventional rule, must
guide us in such direction, and pose as our
modellers of style. Goldsmith and Swift both
may train in that company. But this master we
are now considering wrote so swiftly and dashed
so strongly into the current of what he had to
say, that he was indifferent to methods and words,
except what went to engage the reader and keep
him always cognizant of his purpose. But do
you say that this is the best aim of all writing?
Most surely it is wise for a writer to hold attention
by what arts he can: failing of this, he fails
of the best half of his intent; but if he gains this
by simple means, by directness, by limpid language,
and no more of it than the thought calls
for, and by such rhythmic and beguiling use
of it as tempts the reader to follow, he is a safer
exemplar than one who by force of genius can
accomplish his aims by loose expressions and
redundance of words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Next it is objected to these old favorites of
ours, that they are not clever in the exhibit
and explication of mental processes, and their
analysis of motives is incomplete. Well, I suppose
this to be true; and that he did, to a certain
extent (as Carlyle used to allege grumblingly),
work from the outside-in. He did live in
times when men fell straightforwardly in love,
without counting the palpitations of the heart;
and when heroes struck honest blows without
reckoning in advance upon the probable contractile
power of their biceps muscles. Again, it
is said that his history often lacks precision and
sureness of statement. Well, the dates are certainly
sometimes twisted a few years out of their
proper lines and seasons; but it is certain, also,
that he does give the atmosphere and the coloring
of historic periods in a completer and more
satisfying way than many much carefuller chroniclers,
and his portraits of great historic personages
are by common consent&mdash;even of the critics&mdash;more
full of the life of their subjects, and of
a realistic exhibit of their controlling characteristics,
than those of the historians proper. Nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
can be more sure than that Scott was not
a man of great critical learning; nothing is more
sure than that he was frequently at fault in
minor details; but who will gainsay the fact that
he was among the most charming and beneficent
of story-tellers?</p>

<p>There may be households which will rule him
out as old fashioned and stumbling, and wordy,
and long; but I know of one, at least, where he
will hold his place, as among the most delightful
of visitors&mdash;and where on winter nights he will
continue to bring with him (as he has brought so
many times already) the royal figure of the Queen
Elizabeth&mdash;shining in her jewels, or sulking in
her coquetries; and Dandie Dinmont, with his
pow-wow of Pepper and Mustard; and King
Jamie, with Steenie and jingling Geordie; and the
patient, prudent, excellent Jeanie Deans; and
the weak, old, amiable mistress of Tillietudlem;
and Rebecca, and the Lady in the Green Mantle,
and Dominie Sampson, and Peter Peebles, and Di
Vernon, and all the rest!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<h3>Glints of Royalty.</h3>

<p>They tell us Scott loved kings: why not?
Romanticism was his nurse, from the days when
he kicked up his baby heels under the shadows of
Smailholme Tower, and Feudalism was his foster-parent.
Always he loved banners and pageantry,
and always the glitter and pomp which give their
under or over tones to his pages of balladry.
And if he stood in awe of titles and of rank, and
felt the cockles of his heart warming in contact
with these, ’twas not by reason of a vulgar tuft-hunting
spirit, nor was it due to the crass toadyism
which seeks reflected benefit; but it grew, I
think, out of sheer mental allegiance to feudal
splendors and traditions.</p>

<p>Whether Scott ever personally encountered the
old king, George III., may be doubtful; but I
recall in some of his easy, family letters (perhaps
to his eldest boy Walter), most respectful and
kindly allusions to the august master of the royal
Windsor household&mdash;who ordered his home
affairs so wisely&mdash;keeping “good hours;” while,
amid the turbulences and unrest which belonged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to the American and French Revolutions&mdash;succeeding
each other in portentous sequence&mdash;he
was waning toward that period of woful mental
imbecility which beset him at last, and which
clouded an earlier chapter<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> of our record. The
Prince Regent&mdash;afterward George IV.&mdash;was always
well disposed toward Scott; had read the
<cite>Minstrel</cite>, and <cite>Marmion</cite>, with the greatest gratification
(he did sometimes read), and told Lord
Byron as much; even comparing the Scot with
Homer&mdash;which was as near to classicism as the
Prince often ran. But Byron, in his <cite>English
Bards</cite>, etc., published in his earlier days, had
made his little satiric dab at the <cite>Minstrel</cite>&mdash;finding
a lively hope in its being <em>the Last</em>!</p>

<p>Murray, however, in the good Christian spirit
which sometimes overtakes publishers, stanched
these wounds, and brought the poets to bask
together in the smiles of royalty. The first
Baronetcy the Prince bestowed&mdash;after coming
to Kingship&mdash;was that which made the author
of Waverley Sir Walter; the poet had witnessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and reported the scenes at the Coronation of
1820 in London; and on the King’s gala visit to
Edinboro’&mdash;when all the heights about the gray
old city boomed with welcoming cannon, and all
the streets and all the water-ways were a-flutter
with tartans and noisy with bagpipes&mdash;it was
Sir Walter who virtually marshalled the hosts,
and gave chieftain-like greeting to the Prince.
Scott’s management of the whole stupendous
paraphernalia&mdash;the banquets, the processions,
the receptions, the decorations (of all which the
charming water-colors of Turner are in evidence)&mdash;gave
wonderful impressions of the masterful resources
and dominating tact of the man; now
clinking glasses (of Glenlivet) with the mellow
King (counting sixty years in that day); now
humoring into quietude the jealousies of Highland
chieftains; again threading Canongate at nightfall
and afoot&mdash;from end to end&mdash;to observe if
all welcoming bannerols and legends are in place;
again welcoming to his home, in the heat of
ceremonial occupation, the white-haired and
trembling poet Crabbe; anon, stealing away to
his Castle Street chamber for a new chapter in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the <cite>Peveril of the Peak</cite> (then upon the anvil), and
in the heat, and fury, and absorption of the whole
gala business breaking out of line with a bowed
head and aching heart, to follow his best friend,
William Erskine (Lord Kinnedder),<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> out by
Queensferry to his burial.</p>

<p>It was only eight years thereafter, when this
poet manager of the great Scotch jubilee&mdash;who
seemed good for the work of a score of years&mdash;sailed,
by royal permission (an act redeeming and
glorifying royalty) upon a Government ship&mdash;seeking
shores and skies which would put new
vigor (if it might be) into a constitution broken
by toil, and into hopes that had been blighted
by blow on blow of sorrow.</p>

<p>Never was a royal favor more worthily bespoken;
never one more vainly bestowed. ’Twas
too late. No human eye&mdash;once so capable of
seeing&mdash;ever opened for a first look so wearily
upon the blue of the Mediterranean&mdash;upon the
marvellous fringed shores of lower Italy&mdash;upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Rome, Florence, and the snowy Swiss portals
of the Simplon.</p>

<p>Royalty (in person of William IV., then on the
throne) asked kindly after the sick magician&mdash;who
was established presently on a sick bed in
London; while the cabmen on street corners near
by talked low of the “great mon” who lay there
a-dying. A little show of recovery gave power to
reach home&mdash;Abbotsford and Tweed-side&mdash;once
more. There was no hope; but it took time for
the great strength in him to waste.</p>

<p>Withal there was a fine glint of royalty at the
end. “Be virtuous, my dear,” he said to Lockhart;
“be a good man.” And that utterance&mdash;the
summing up of forty years of brilliant accomplishment,
and of baffled ambitions&mdash;emphasized
by the trembling voice of a dying man&mdash;will
dwell longer in human memories, and more worthily,
than the empty baronial pile we call Abbotsford,
past which the scurrying waters of
the Tweed ripple and murmur&mdash;as they did on
the day Sir Walter was born, and on the day he
was buried at Dryburgh.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">Our last chapter was opened by a rather
full sketch of Professor Wilson, and a
briefer one of Thomas Campbell&mdash;who though
of higher repute as a poet, was a far less interesting
man. We then entered upon what may
have seemed a very inadequate account of the
great author of Waverley&mdash;because I presumed
upon the reader’s full and ready knowledge; and
because the Minstrel’s grand stride over all the
Scottish country that is worth the seeing, and
over all that domain in English Lands and Letters,
which he made his own, has been noted by scores
of tourists, and by scores of admiring commentators.
You may believe me in saying&mdash;that
his story was not scrimped for lack of love; indeed,
it would have been easy to riot in talk
about the lively drum-beat of his poems, or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
livelier and more engaging charms of his prose
Romance&mdash;through two chapters or through
ten. But we must get on; there is a long road
before us yet.</p>

<h3>A Start in Life.</h3>

<p>It was somewhere about the year 1798, that a
sharp-faced, youngish Englishman&mdash;who had
been curate of a small country parish down in
Wiltshire&mdash;drove, upon a pleasant June day, on
a coach-top, into the old city of Edinboro’. This
clergyman had a young lad seated beside him,
whom he was tutoring; and this tutoring business
enabled the curate to take a respectable
house in the city. And by reason of the respectable
house, and his own pleasant humor
and intelligence, he came after a year or two to
know a great many of the better folk in Edinboro’,
and was invited to preach an occasional
sermon at a small Episcopal chapel in his neighborhood.
But all the good people he met did
not prevent his being a-hungered after a young
person whom he had left in the south of England.
So he took a vacation presently and fetched her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
back, a bride, to the Scottish capital&mdash;having
(as he said) thrown all his fortune in her lap.
This fortune was of maternal inheritance, and
consisted of six well-worn silver teaspoons.
There was excellent society in Edinboro’ in that
day, among the ornaments of which was Henry
Mackenzie,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> a stately gentleman&mdash;a sort of dean
of the literary coteries, and the author of books
which it is well to know by name&mdash;<cite>The Man of
Feeling</cite> and <cite>Julia de Roubigné</cite>&mdash;written with
great painstaking and most exalted sentiment,
and&mdash;what we count now&mdash;much dreariness.
Then there was a Rev. Archibald Alison&mdash;he too
an Episcopal clergyman, though Scotch to the
backbone&mdash;and the author of an ingenious, but
not very pregnant book, still to be found in
old-fashioned libraries, labelled, <cite>Alison on Taste</cite>.
Dugald Stewart was then active, and did on one
or two occasions bring his honored presence to
the little chapel to hear the preaching of the
young English curate I spoke of. And this young
curate, poor as he is and with a young wife, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
an itch for getting into print; and does after a
little time (the actual date being 1800) publish
a booklet, which you will hardly find now, entitled
<cite>Six Sermons preached at Charlotte Chapel,
Edinboro, by Rev. Sydney Smith</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> But it was
not so much these sermons, as his wit and brightness
and great range of information, which
brought him into easy intimacy with the most
promising young men of the city. Walter Scott
he may have encountered odd whiles, though
the novelist was in those days bent on his hunt
after Border Minstrelsy, and would have been shy
of the rampant liberalism ingrained with Smith.</p>

<p>But the curate did meet often, and most intimately,
a certain prim, delicate, short-statured,
black-eyed, smug, ambitious, precocious young
advocate named Francis Jeffrey; and it was in
a chamber of this latter&mdash;up three pair of
stairs in Buccleugh Place&mdash;that Sydney Smith,
on a certain occasion, proposed to the host and
two or three other friends there present, the establishment
of a literary journal to be published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
quarterly; and out of that proposition grew
straightway that famous <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> which
in its covers of buff and blue has thrived for over
ninety years now&mdash;throwing its hot shot into all
opposing camps of politics or of letters. I have
designated two of the arch plotters, Sydney Smith
and Jeffrey. Francis Horner<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> was another who
was in at the start; he, too, a young Scotch lawyer,
who went to London on the very year of the establishment
of the journal, but writing for its early
issues, well and abundantly. Most people know
him now only by the beautiful statue of him by
Chantrey, which stands in Westminster Abbey;
it has a noble head, full of intellect&mdash;full of integrity.
Sydney Smith said the Ten Commandments
were writ all over his face. Yet the marble
shows a tenderness of soul not common to
those who, like him, had made a profession of politics,
and entered upon a parliamentary career.
But the career was short; he died in 1817&mdash;not
yet forty&mdash;leaving a reputation that was spotless;
had he lived, he would have come, without a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
doubt, to the leadership of liberal opinion in England.
The mourning for him was something
extraordinary in its reach, and its sincerity; a
remarkable man&mdash;whose politics never up-rooted
his affections, and whose study of the laws of
trade did not spoil his temper, or make him
abusive. His example, and his repeated advices,
in connection with the early history of the <cite>Review</cite>,
were always against the personalities and
ugly satire which were strong features of it in the
first years, and which had their source&mdash;very
largely&mdash;in the influences and pertinacity of
another member of the <cite>Review</cite> Syndicate; I mean
Henry Brougham.</p>

<h3>Henry Brougham.</h3>

<p>This was another young lawyer&mdash;of Scottish
birth, but of Cumberland stock; ambitious like
Jeffrey and equally clever, though in a different
line; he was ungainly and lank of limb; with a
dogmatic and presuming manner, and a noticeably
aggressive nose which became afterward the
handle (and a very good handle it made) for
those illustrative caricatures of Mr. Punch, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
lasted for a generation. Brougham<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> was always
a debater from his boy-days&mdash;and not a little
of a bully and outlaw; precocious too&mdash;a capital
Latinist&mdash;writing a paper on Optics at eighteen,
which found publishment in the Philosophical
Transactions; member of the Speculative Society
where Jeffrey and Mackintosh, and Alison were
wont to go, and where his disputatious spirit ran
riot. He didn’t love to agree with anybody; one
of those men it would seem who hardly wished his
dinner to agree with him.</p>

<p>Yet Brougham was one of the master spirits in
this new enterprise, and became a great historic
personage. His reputation was indeed rather political
and forensic, than literary, and in his writings
he inclined to scientific discussion. He had,
however, a streak of purely literary ambition, and
wrote a novel at one period of his life&mdash;after he
had reached maturity&mdash;which he called a philosophic
Romance.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Indeed this bantling was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
swaddled, in philosophic wrappings that it could
have made no noise. Very few knew of it; fewer
still ever read it. He said, “It had not enough
of indecency and blasphemy in it to make it popular”
(it was written when Byron was in high repute).
But the few who did read it thought there
were other reasons for its want of success.</p>

<p>He drifted quickly away from Edinboro’,
though long keeping up his connection with the
<cite>Review</cite>; became famous as an advocate&mdash;notably
in connection with Queen Caroline’s trial;
went into Parliament; was eventually Lord High
Chancellor, and won a place in the Peerage. He
was associated intimately, too, with great beneficent
schemes&mdash;such as the suppression of the
slave trade, the establishment of the London University,
the founding of the Society for the Diffusion
of Useful Knowledge, and the urgence of
the great Reform measures of 1832. Yet in all
these, he arrogated more than his share of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
honor, wearying his associates by incessant bickering
and scolding, picking flaws in everything not
entirely his own; jealous, suspicious, conceited to
the last degree; never generous in praise of one
living beside him; an enormous worker, with
sinews of iron, and on occasions (which are of record)
speaking and wrangling in the House of
Commons until two of the morning, and then going
home&mdash;not to sleep&mdash;but to write a thirty-page
article for the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>. Such men
make a place for themselves, and keep it. He
was an acrid debater, but a most thorough one&mdash;holding
all aspects of a case in view; never getting
muddled; ready with facts; ready with fallacies
(if needed); ready for all and any interruptions;
setting them on fire by the stress of his
argumentation&mdash;like carbons in an electric circuit;
ready with storms of irony and running
into rough-edged sarcasm with singular ease and
sharpest appetite.</p>

<p>On a May evening of 1845 the present writer had
the pleasure of watching him for an hour or more
in the House of Lords. He was lank, as I have
said; awkward, nervous, restless; twisting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
great seals at his watch-chain; intent upon everything;
now and then sniffing the air, like a terrier
that has lost the scent; presenting a petition, in
the course of the session, in favor of some Newfoundland
clients who were anxious for more direct
postal communication&mdash;who objected that their
mails were sent in a roundabout way <i lang="la">via</i> Halifax.
Whereupon Lord Stanley (afterward Earl Derby),
then Secretary for the Colonies, rose in explanation,
“regretting that his Lordship had not communicated
with the Colonial Office, which had
considered the question raised; there was no communication
by land; the harbor was often closed
by ice; therefore present methods were followed,”
etc. All of which was set forth with most charming
grace and suavity; but Lord Stanley was no
sooner ended than the irascible Scotch peer, nettled,
as would seem, by the very graciousness of
the explanation, was upon his feet in an instant,
with a sharp “M’ Lards,” that promised fun;
and thereafter came a fusillade of keenest, ironical
speech&mdash;thanking the honorable Secretary for
“the vera impartant information, that as St.
John’s was upon an island, there could be no communication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
by land; and perhaps his learned
<em>Lardship</em> supposes, with an acumen commensurate
with his <em>great</em> geographic knowledge, that the
sending of the mails by the way of Halifax will
have a tendency to <em>thaw</em> the ice in the Harbor of
St. John’s,” and so on, for a ten minute’s storm
of satiric and witty banter. And then&mdash;an awkward
plunge backward into his seat&mdash;a new,
nervous twirling of his watch-seals, a curious smile
of self-approval, followed by a lapse into the old
nervous unrest.</p>

<p>There was no serenity in Brougham&mdash;no repose&mdash;scarce
any dignity. His petulance and angry
sarcasm and frequent ill-nature made him a much
hated man in his latter days, and involved him
in abusive tirades, which people were slow to
forgive.</p>

<h3>Francis Jeffrey.</h3>

<p>As for Mr. Jeffrey, his associate on the <cite>Review</cite>,
and for many years its responsible editor, he
was a very different man&mdash;of easy address, courteous,
gentlemanly&mdash;quite a master of deportment.
Yet it was he who ripped open with his
critical knife Southey’s <cite>Thalaba</cite> and the early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
poems of Wordsworth. But even his victims
forgot his severities in his pleasantly magnetic
presence and under the caressing suavities of his
manner. He was brisk, <i lang="fr">débonnaire</i>, cheery&mdash;a
famous talker; not given to anecdotes or storytelling,
but bubbling over with engaging book-lore
and poetic hypotheses, and eager to put
them into those beautiful shapes of language
which came&mdash;as easily as water flows&mdash;to his
pen or to his tongue. He said harsh things, not
for love of harsh things; but because what provoked
them grated on his tastes, or his sense of
what was due to Belles Lettres. One did not&mdash;after
conversing with him&mdash;recall great special
aptness of remark or of epithet, so much as the
charmingly even flow of apposite and illustrative
language&mdash;void of all extravagances and of all
wickednesses, too. Lord Cockburn says of his
conversation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The listeners’ pleasure was enhanced by the personal
littleness of the speaker. A large man [Jeffrey was very
small] could scarcely have thrown off Jeffrey’s conversational
flowers without exposing himself to ridicule. But
the liveliness of the deep thoughts and the flow of bright expressions
that animated his talk, seemed so natural and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
appropriate to the figure that uttered them, that they were
heard with something of the delight with which the slenderness
of the trembling throat and the quivering of the wings
make us enjoy the strength and clearness of the notes of a
little bird.”<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The first Mrs. Jeffrey dying early in life, he
married for second wife a very charming American
lady, Miss Wilkes;<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> having found time&mdash;notwithstanding
his engrossment with the <cite>Review</cite>&mdash;for
an American journey, at the end of which
he carried home his bride. Some of his letters
to his wife’s kindred in America are very delightful&mdash;setting
forth the new scenes to which the
young wife had been transported. He knew just
what to say and what not to say, to make his
pictures perfect. The trees, the church-towers,
the mists, the mosses on walls, the gray heather&mdash;all
come into them, under a touch that is as light
as a feather, and as sharp as a diamond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>His honors in his profession of advocate grew,
and he came by courtesy to the title of Lord
Jeffrey&mdash;(not to be confounded with that other
murderous Lord Jeffreys, who was judicial hangman
for James II.). He is in Parliament too;
never an orator properly; but what he says, always
clean cut, sensible, picturesque, flowing smoothly&mdash;but
rather over the surface of things than
into their depths. Accomplished is the word
to apply to him; accomplished largely and variously,
and with all his accomplishments perfectly
in hand.</p>

<p>Those two hundred papers which he wrote in
the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> are of the widest range&mdash;charmingly
and piquantly written. Yet they do
not hold place among great and popular essays;
not with Macaulay, or Mackintosh, or Carlyle,
or even Hazlitt. He was French in his literary
aptitudes and qualities; never heavy; touching
things, as we have said, with a feather’s point, yet
touching them none the less surely.</p>

<p>Could he have written a book to live? His
friends all thought it, and urged him thereto. He
thought not. There would be great toil, he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and mortification at the end; so he lies buried,
where we leave him, under a great tumulus of
most happy <cite>Review</cite> writing.</p>

<h3>Sydney Smith.</h3>

<p>I return now to the clever English curate who
was the first to propose the establishment of that
great Northern <cite>Review</cite>, out of which Lord Jeffrey
grew. Smith had written very much and well,
and had cracked his jokes in a way to be heard by
all the good people of Edinboro’. But he was
poor, and his wife poor; he had his fortune to
make; and plainly was not making it there, tutoring
his one pupil. So, in 1804, he struck out for
London, to carve his way to fortune. He knew
few there; but his clever papers in the <cite>Review</cite>
gave him introduction to Whig circles, and a
social plant, which he never forfeited. Lord and
Lady Holland greatly befriended him; and he early
came to a place at the hospitable board of
that famous Holland House&mdash;of whose green
quietudes we have had glimpses, in connection
with Addison, and in connection with Charles Fox&mdash;and
whose mistress in the days we are now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
upon, showed immense liking for the brilliant and
witty parson.</p>

<p>All this while, the Rev. Sydney was seeking
preaching chances; but was eyed doubtfully by
those who had pulpits in their gift. He was too
independent&mdash;too witty&mdash;too radical&mdash;too hateful
of religious conventionalisms&mdash;too <i>Edinburgh
Reviewish</i>. Neither was he a great orator; rather
scornful of explosive clap-trap or of noisy pulpit
rhetoric; yet he had a resonant voice&mdash;earnest
in every note and trill; often sparkling
to his points in piquant, conversational way, but
wanting quick-witted ones for their reception and
comprehension. He lacked too, in a measure&mdash;what
is another great resource for a preacher&mdash;the
unction which comes of deep, sustained, devotional
feeling, and a conviction of the unmatchable
importance and efficacy of sacerdotal influences.
I think there was no time in his life when
he would not rather beguile a wayward soul by
giving him a good, bright witticism to digest than
by exhibit of the terrors of the Law. His Gospel&mdash;by
preference&mdash;was an intellectual gospel; yet
not one that reposed on creeds and formulas. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
heart was large, and his tolerance full. He was a
proud Churchman indeed, and loved to score dissenters;
but delighted in the crack of his witticisms,
more than he mourned over their apostasy.
Among the “evening meetings” that he knew
very much of, and specially relished, were those at
his own little homestead, with closed blinds, and
a few friends, and hot-water, and&mdash;lemons!</p>

<p>I do not at all mean to imply that he had habits
of dissipation, or was ever guilty of vulgar excesses.
Of all such he had a wholesome horror;
but along with it, he had a strong and abiding
fondness for what he counted the good things of
life, and the bright things, and the play of wit,
and the encounter of scholarly weapons.</p>

<p>One beautiful priestly quality, however, always
shone in him: that was his kindliness for the
poor and feeble&mdash;his sympathy with them&mdash;his
working for their benefit; and though he trusted
little in appeals to the mere emotional nature, yet
in his charity sermons he drew such vivid pictures
of the suffering poor folk who had come under his
eye, as to put half his auditors in tears.</p>

<p>His preaching in London at this early period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
was for the most part at an out-of-the-way chapel,
in connection with a Foundling Hospital; but he
gave a series of Philosophic Lectures at the Royal
Institution&mdash;never reckoned by himself with his
good work&mdash;which were besieged by people who
came to enjoy his witty sayings. In a few years,
however, he secured a valuable church gift in
Yorkshire, where he built a rectory&mdash;the ugliest
and “honest-est house” in the county&mdash;and entertained
London and Scottish friends there, and
grew to enjoy&mdash;much as he could&mdash;the trees,
flowers, and lawns which he planted, and with
which he coquetted, though only in a half-hearted
way. His supreme love was for cities and crowds;
he counting the country at its best only a kind
of “healthy grave”; flowers, turf, birds are very
well in their way, he says, but not worth an hour
of the rational conversation only to be had
where a million are gathered in one spot.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>And he does at last come to the million&mdash;getting,
after his Whig friends came into power, and
after the Reform revolution was over, the royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
appointment to a canonry in connection with St.
Paul’s Cathedral.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>He also has the gift of a new country “living”
in Somersetshire, where he passes his later summer
in another delightfully equipped home; and
between these two church holdings, and certain
legacies conveniently falling due, he has a large
income at command, and enjoys it, and makes the
poor of his parishes enjoy it too.</p>

<p>He has taken a lusty hand in that passage of the
Reform bill (1832), and while its success seemed
still to be threatened by the sullen opposition of
the House of Lords, he made that famous witty
comparison in which he likened the popular interest
in Reform to a great storm and tide which had
set in from the Atlantic, and the opposition of the
Lords, to the efforts of Dame Partington, who
lived upon the beach, and&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“who was seen at the door of her house with mops and
pattens, trundling her mop, squeezing out the sea-water, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
vigorously pushing away the Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic
was roused. Mrs. Partington’s spirit was up. But I need
not tell you the contest was unequal. The Atlantic Ocean
beat Mrs. Partington. She was excellent at a slop or a
puddle, but she should not have meddled with a tempest.”</p>

</div>

<p>And this happy and droll comparison was met
with a great roar of laughter and of applause that
ran all over England. The same tactics of witty
ridicule belonged also to his attacks upon Tractarianism
and Puseyism, which made stir in his
latter days. Indeed, his bump of veneration was
very small; and his drollery creeps into his letters
as into his speech. He writes of a visit to Edinboro’:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“My old friends were glad to see me; some were turned
Methodists, some had lost their teeth, some had grown very
fat, some were dying, and, alas! many were dead. But the
world is a coarse enough place; so I talked away, comforted
some, praised others, kissed some old ladies, and passed a
very riotous week.”<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

</div>

<p>He writes to Moore, the poet:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Moore</span>: I have a breakfast of philosophers at ten,
punctually, to-morrow&mdash;‘muffins and metaphysics, crumpets
and contradiction.’ Will you come?”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>When Mrs. Smith is ailing at her new home in
Somersetshire he says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash; has eight distinct illnesses, and I have
nine. We take something every hour, and pass the mixture
between us.”</p>

</div>

<p>One part of his suffering comes of hay fever, as
to which he says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Light, dust, contradiction&mdash;the sight of a dissenter&mdash;anything
sets me sneezing; and if I begin sneezing at
twelve, I don’t leave off till two, and am heard distinctly in
Taunton (when the wind sets that way), a distance of six
miles.”</p>

</div>

<p>This does not show quite so large a reserve and
continence of speech as we naturally look for in
the clerical profession; but this, and other such
do, I think, set the Rev. Sydney Smith before us,
with his witty proclivities, and his unreserve, and
his spirit of frolic, as no citations from his moral
and intellectual philosophy could ever do. And
I easily figure to myself this portly, well-preserved
gentleman of St. Paul’s, fighting the weaknesses of
the gout with a gold-headed cane, and picking his
way of an afternoon along the pavements of Piccadilly,
with eye as bright as a bird’s, and beak as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
sharp as a bird’s&mdash;regaling himself with the
thought of the dinner for which he is booked,
and of the brilliant talkers he is to encounter,
with the old parry and thrust, at Rogers’s rooms,
or under the noble ceiling of Holland House.</p>

<h3>A Highlander.</h3>

<p>Another writer&mdash;whose sympathies from the beginning
were with the Liberalism of the <cite>Edinburgh
Review</cite> (though not a contributor till some years
after its establishment) was Sir James Mackintosh.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
A Highlander by birth&mdash;he was at Aberdeen
University&mdash;afterwards in Edinboro’, where
he studied medicine, and getting his Doctorate,
set up in London&mdash;eking out a support, which
his medical practice did not bring, by writing for
the papers.</p>

<p>This was at the date when the recent French
Revolution and its issues were at the top of
all men’s thoughts; and when Burke had just
set up his glittering bulwark of eloquence and
of sentiment in his famous “Reflections”; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
our young Doctor (Mackintosh)&mdash;full of a bumptious
Whiggism, undertook a reply to the great
statesman&mdash;a reply so shrewd, so well-seasoned,
so sound&mdash;that it brought to the young Scotchman
(scarce twenty-five in those days) a fame he
never outlived. It secured him the acquaintance
of Fox and Sheridan, and the friendship of Burke,
who in his latter days invited the young pamphleteer,
who had so strongly, yet respectfully,
antagonized his views, to pass a Christmas with
him at his home of Beaconsfield. Of course, such
a success broke up the doctoring business, and
launched Mackintosh upon a new career. He devoted
himself to politics; was some time an accredited
lecturer upon the law of nations; was
knighted presently and sent to Bombay on civil
service. His friends hoped he might find financial
equipment there, but this hope was vain; red-tape
was an abomination to him always; cash-book
and ledger represented unknown quantities;
he knew no difference between a shilling and a
pound, till he came to spend them. He was in
straits all his life.</p>

<p>His friendship for Jeffrey, Sydney Smith, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Brougham was maintained by correspondence,
and on his return from India he became an occasional
contributor to the great Scotch <cite>Review</cite> on
various subjects.</p>

<p>His range of acquirements was most wide&mdash;too
wide and too unceasing for the persistency which
goes with great single achievements. His histories
are fragments. His speeches are misplaced
treatises; his treatises are epitomes of didactic
systems. When we weigh his known worth, his
keenness of intellect, his sound judgment, his
wealth of language, his love for thoroughness&mdash;which
led him to remotest sources of information&mdash;his
amazing power in colloquial discourse, we
are astonished at the little store of good things he
has left. There was a lack in him, indeed, of the
salient and electrical wit of Sydney Smith; a
lack of the easy and graceful volubility of Jeffrey;
lack of the abounding and illuminating rhetoric
of Macaulay; but a greater lack was of that
dogged, persistent working habit which gave to
Brougham his triumphs.</p>

<p>Yet Mackintosh was always plotting great literary
designs; but his fastidious taste, and his critical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
hunger for all certainties, kept him forever in
the search of new material and appliances. He
was dilatory to the last degree; his caution always
multiplied delays; no general was ever so watchful
of his commissariat&mdash;none ever so unready
for a “Forward, march!” Among his forecasts
was that of a great history of England. Madame
de Staël urged her friend to take possession of her
villa on Lake Geneva and, like Gibbon, write his
way there to a great fame. He did for awhile set
himself resolutely to a beginning at the country
home of Weedon Lodge in Buckinghamshire&mdash;accumulated
piles of fortifying MSS. and private
records; but for outcome we have only that clumsy
torso which outlines the Revolution of 1688.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>His plans wanted a hundred working years, instead
of the thirty which are only allotted to men.
What Jeffrey left behind him marks, I think, the
full limit of his powers; the same is true of
Brougham, and true probably of Macaulay; and
I think no tension and no incentive would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
wrought upon Sydney Smith to work greater and
brighter things than he did accomplish. A bishopric
would only have set his gibes into coruscation
at greater tables, and perhaps given larger
system to his charities. But Mackintosh never
worked up to the full level of his best power and
large learning, except in moments of conversational
exaltation.</p>

<h3>Rest at Cannes.</h3>

<p>Before closing our chapter we take one more
swift glimpse at that arch-plotter for Whiggism&mdash;in
the early days of the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>&mdash;whom
we left fidgetting in the House of Lords,
on a May evening of 1845. He had a longer life
by far than most of those who conspired for the
maintenance of the great blue and buff forerunner
of British critical journals. He was only
twenty-three when he put his shoulder to the
quarterly revolutions of the <cite>Edinburgh</cite>&mdash;youngest
of all the immediate founders;<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and he outlived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
them all and outvoiced them all in the
hurly-burly of the world.</p>

<p>He survived Macaulay too&mdash;an early contributor
of whom we shall have more to say&mdash;and
though he was past eighty at the death of the
historian, he was alert still, and his brain vagrantly
active; but the days of his early glory and
fame&mdash;when the young blusterer bolstered up
Reform, and slew the giants of musty privilege
and sent “the schoolmaster abroad,” and antagonized
slavery, were gone;<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> so, too, were those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
palmy times when he made the courts at Westminster
ring with his championship of that poor
Queen (who, whatever her demerits&mdash;and they
were many&mdash;was certainly abominably maltreated
by a husband far worse than she); times when the
populace who espoused her cause shouted bravos
to Harry Brougham&mdash;times when he was the best
known and most admired man in England; all
these, and his chancellorship, and his wordy triumphs
in the House of Lords, were far behind
him, and the inevitable loss of place and power
fretted him grievously. He quarrelled with old
coadjutors; in Parliament he shifted from bench
to bench; in the weakness of age, he truckled
to power; he exasperated his friends, and for
years together&mdash;his scoldings, his tergiversations,
and his plaid trousers made a mine of mockery for
Mr. Punch. As early as 1835-40, Lord Brougham
had purchased an estate in the south of France,
in a beautiful nook of that mountain shore which
sweeps eastward from the neighborhood of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Marseilles&mdash;along the Mediterranean, and which so
many travellers now know by the delights of the
Cornice Road and Monaco, and Mentone, and
San Remo. The little fishing village where years
ago Lord Brougham set up his Villa of Louise
Eléonore (after a darling and lost child) is now a
suburb of the fashionable resort of Cannes. At
his home there, amongst the olives, the oleanders
and the orange-trees, the disappointed and petulant
ex-chancellor passed most of the later years
of his life.</p>

<p>Friends dropping in upon him&mdash;much doubting
of their reception&mdash;found him as the humors
changed, peevish with strong regrets and recriminations,
or placid under the weight of his years,
and perhaps narcotized by the marvellous beauty
of the scenes around him.</p>

<p>He was over ninety at his death in 1868. To
the very last, a man not to be reckoned on: some
days as calm as the sea that rippled under his
window; other days full of his old unrest and
petulancies. There are such men in all times
and in all societies&mdash;sagacious, fussy, vain, indefatigable,
immensely serviceable, cantankerous;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
we <em>can’t</em> get on without them; we are for ever
wishing that we could.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In our next chapter we shall come upon a critic,
who was a famous editor&mdash;adroit, strong, waspish,
bookish, and ignoble. We shall encounter a king,
too&mdash;of whom we have thus far only had glimpses&mdash;who
was jolly&mdash;excellently limbed and conditioned
physically&mdash;a man “of an infinite jest,”
too, and yet as arrant a dastard&mdash;by all old-fashioned
moral measures of character&mdash;as Falstaff
himself. Again we shall follow traces of a great
poet&mdash;but never a favorite one&mdash;who has left
markings of his career, strong and deep; a man
who had a Greek’s delight in things of beauty,
and a Greek’s subtlety of touch; but one can fancy
a faun’s ears showing their tips upon his massive
head, and (without fancy) grow conscious of
a heathenism clouding his great culture. Other
two poets of lighter mould we shall meet;&mdash;more
gracious, lighter pinioned&mdash;prettily flitting&mdash;iridescent&mdash;grace
and sparkle in their utterances,
but leaving no strong markings “upon the sands
of time.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">We have wandered much in our two last
chapters beyond what may be reckoned
strictly English lands, into that pleasant region
lying between the Tweed and the Firth of
Forth; and it was north of the heights of Lammermuir
and of the Pentland Hills, and in that
delightful old city which is dominated by the
lesser heights of the Salisbury crags, the Castle
Rock, and Calton Hill, that we found the
builders of that great <cite>Review</cite>, which in its livery
of buff and blue still carries its original name.
I traced the several careers of Sydney Smith,
Lord Brougham, and Judge Jeffrey; the first of
these, from a humble village curacy, coming to
be one of the most respected literary men of
England, and an important official of St. Paul’s
Cathedral; if his wit had been less lively he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
might have risen to a bishopric. Brougham was,
first, essayist, then advocate, then Parliamentary
orator, then Reformer, then Lord High Chancellor&mdash;purging
the courts of much legal trumpery&mdash;always
a scold and quarreller, and gaining
in the first year of William IV. his barony
of Brougham and Vaux: hence the little squib
of verse, which will help to keep his exact title
in mind:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Why is Lord Brougham like a sweeping man</div>
<div class="verse indent1">That close by the pavement walks?</div>
<div class="verse">Because when he’s done all the sweep that he can</div>
<div class="verse indent1">He takes up his <em>Broom</em> and <em>Valks</em>!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As for Jeffrey, he became by his resolute
industry and his literary graces and aptitudes one
of the most admired and honored critics of Great
Britain.</p>

<h3>Gifford and His Quarterly.</h3>

<p>Our start-point to-day is on the Thames&mdash;in
that devouring city of London, which very early
in the century was laying its tentacles of growth
on all the greenness that lay between Blackwall
and Bayswater, and which&mdash;athwart the Thames<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
shores&mdash;strode blightingly from Clapham to
Hackney.</p>

<p>It was, I believe, in the year 1809 that Mr.
John Murray, the great publisher of London&mdash;stirred,
perhaps, by some incentive talk of Walter
Scott, or of other good Tory penmen, and emulous
of the success which had attended Jeffrey’s <cite>Review</cite>
in the north, established a rival one&mdash;called simply
<cite>The Quarterly</cite>&mdash;intended to represent the Tory
interests as unflinchingly and aggressively as the
<cite>Edinburgh</cite> had done Whig interests. The first
editor was a William Gifford<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> (a name worth remembering
among those of British critics), who
was born in Devonshire. He was the son of a dissolute
house-painter, and went to sea in his young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
days, but was afterwards apprenticed to a shoemaker.
Some piquant rhymes he made in those
days attracting the attention of benevolent gentlemen,
he was put in the way of schooling, and at
Oxford, where he studied. It was while there he
meditated, and perhaps executed, some of those
clever translations from Persius and Juvenal,
which he published somewhat later. He edited
Ben Jonson’s works in a clumsy and disputatious
way, and in some of his earlier, crude, satirical
rhymes (<cite>Baviad</cite>) paid his respects to Madame
Thrale in this fashion:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“See Thrale’s gay widow with a satchel roam,</div>
<div class="verse">And bring in pomp laborious nothings home.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Again he pounces upon the biographer of Dr.
Johnson thus-wise:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Boswell, aping with preposterous pride,</div>
<div class="verse">Johnson’s worst frailties, rolls from side to side,</div>
<div class="verse">His heavy head from hour to hour erects,</div>
<div class="verse">Affects the fool, and is what he affects.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These lines afford a very good measure of his
poetic grace and aptitude; but they give only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
remote idea of his wonderful capacity for abusing
people who did not think as he thought. He
had a genius in this direction, which could not
have discredited an editorial room in New York&mdash;or
elsewhere. Walter Scott&mdash;a warm political
friend&mdash;speaks of him as “a little man, dumpled
up together, and so ill-made as to seem almost
deformed;” and I think that kindly gentleman
was disposed to attribute much of the critic’s
rancor to his invalidism; but if we measure his
printed bile in this way, there must be credited
him not only his usual rheumatic twinges, but
a pretty constant dyspepsia, if not a chronic
neuralgia. Of a certainty he was a most malignant
type of British party critics; and it is
curious how the savors of its first bitterness do
still linger about the pages of the <cite>Quarterly
Review</cite>.</p>

<p>John Wilson Croker<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> will be best known to our
readers as the editor of that edition of Boswell’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
“Johnson,” to which I have alluded. Within the
last ten years, however, his memoirs and correspondence,
in two bulky volumes, have excited a
certain languid interest, and given entertainment
to those who are curious in respect to the political
wire-pullings of the early part of this century in
London. He was an ardent co-worker with Gifford
in the early history of the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>.
He loved a lord every whit as well as Gifford, and
by dint of a gentlemanly manner and gentlemanly
associations was not limited to the “back-stairs
way” of Mr. Gifford in courting those in authority.
His correspondence with dukes and earls&mdash;to all
of whom he is a “dear Croker”&mdash;abound; and
his account of interviews with the Prince Regent,
and of dinners at the Pavilion in Brighton, are
quite Boswellian in their particularity and in
their atmosphere of worship. There is also long
account in the book to which I have called attention,
of a private discourse by George IV., of
which Mr. Croker was sole auditor; and it is hard
to determine whether Croker is more elated by
having the discourse to record, or Mr. Jennings
by having such a record to edit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<h3>A Prince Regent.</h3>

<p>This royal mention brings us once more, for a
little space, to our background of kings. Of the
old monarch, George III., we have had frequent
and full glimpses. We wish to know something
now of that new prince (whom we saw in our
Scott chapter), but who in 1810, when his father’s
faculties failed altogether, became Regent; and
we wish to learn what qualities are in him and
under what training they developed.</p>

<p>The old father had a substructure of good,
hard sense that showed itself through all his obstinacies;
for instance, when Dr. Markham, who
was appointed tutor to his two oldest sons&mdash;Prince
of Wales and Duke of York&mdash;asked how
he should treat them, the old king said: “Treat
them? Why, to be sure, as you would any gentleman’s
sons! If they need the birch, give them
the birch, as you would have done at Westminster.”
But when they had advanced a bit, and a certain
Dr. Arnold (a later tutor) undertook the same
regimen, the two princes put their forces together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and gave the doctor such a drubbing that he
never tried birch again. But it was always a very
close life the princes led in their young days; the
old king was very rigorous in respect of hours and
being out at night. By reason of which George
IV. looked sharply after his opportunities, when
they did come, and made up for that early cloisterhood
by a large laxity of regimen.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Indeed, he
opened upon a very glittering career of dissipations&mdash;the
old father groaning and grumbling and
squabbling against it vainly.</p>

<p>It was somewhere about 1788 or 1789, just when
the French Revolution was beginning to throw
its bloody foam over the tops of the Bastille, that
temporary insanity in the old King George III.
did for a very brief space bring the Prince into
consequence as Regent. Of the happening of
this, and of the gloom in the palace, there is story
in the diary of Madame D’Arblay,<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> who was herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
in attendance upon the Queen. If, indeed,
George III. had stayed mad from that date, and
the Prince&mdash;then in his fullest vigor, and a great
friend of Fox and other Liberal leaders&mdash;had
come to the full and uninterrupted responsibility
of the Regency, his career might have been very
different. But the old king rallied, and for
twenty years thereafter put his obstinacies and
Tory caution in the way of the Prince, who, with
no political royalties to engage him, and no important
official duties (though he tried hard to
secure military command), ran riot in the old way.
He lavishes money on Carlton House; builds
a palace for Mrs. Fitzherbert; coquets with
Lady Jersey; affects the fine gentleman. No
man in London was prouder of his walk, his cane,
his club nonchalance, his taste in meats, his
knowledge of wines, ragoûts, indelicate songs, and
arts of the toilette. Withal, he is well-made, tall,
of most graceful address, a capital story-teller,
too; an indefatigable diner-out; a very fashion-plate
in dress&mdash;corsetted, puffed out in the chest
like a pouter pigeon; all the while running vigorously
and scandalously in debt, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
father is setting himself squarely against any further
parliamentary grant in his favor. There
are, however&mdash;or will be&mdash;relentings in the
old King’s mind, if “Wales” will promise to
settle down in life and marry his cousin, Caroline
of Brunswick&mdash;if, indeed, he be not already
married to Mrs. Fitzherbert, which some avow
and some deny. It does not appear that the
Prince is very positive in his declarations on
this point&mdash;yes or no. So he filially yields and
accedes to a marriage, which by the conditions
of the bargain is to bring him £70,000 to pay
his debts withal. She is twenty-seven&mdash;a good-looking,
spirited Brunswicker woman, who sets
herself to speaking English&mdash;nips in the bud
some love-passages she has at home, and comes
over to conquer the Prince’s affections&mdash;which
she finds it a very hard thing to do. He is
polite, however; is agreeably disposed to the marriage
scheme, which finds exploitation with a
great flourish of trumpets in the Chapel Royal of
St. James. The old King is delighted with his
niece; the old Queen is a little cool, knowing that
the Prince does not care a penny for the bride,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and believing that she ought to have found that
out.</p>

<p>She does find it out, however, in good time; and
finds out about Mrs. Fitzherbert and her fine
house; and does give her Prince some very severe
curtain lectures&mdash;beginning early in that branch
of wifely duty. The Prince takes it in dudgeon;
and the dudgeon grows bigger and bigger on both
sides (as such things will); finally, a year or more
later&mdash;after the birth of her daughter, the Princess
Charlotte&mdash;proposals for separation are
passed between them (with a great flourish of
diplomacy and golden sticks), and accepted with
exceeding cordiality on both sides.</p>

<p>Thereafter, the Prince becomes again a man
about town&mdash;very much about town indeed.
Everybody in London knows his great bulk, his
fine waistcoats, his horses, his hats and his wonderful
bows, which are made with a grace that
seems in itself to confer knighthood. For very
many years his domestic life,&mdash;what little there
was of it,&mdash;passed without weighty distractions.
His Regency when established (1811) was held
through a very important period of British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
history; those great waves of Continental war
which ended in Waterloo belonged to it; so did
the American war of 1812; so did grave disaffection
and discontent at home. He did not quarrel
with his cabinets, or impede their action; he
learned how to yield, and how to conciliate.
Were it only for this, ’tis hardly fair to count him
a mere posture-master and a dandy.</p>

<p>He loved, too, and always respected his old
mother, the Queen of George III.;<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> loved too,&mdash;in
a way&mdash;and more than any other creature in
the world except himself, that darling daughter
of his, the Princess Charlotte, who at seventeen
became the bride of Leopold, afterward King of
Belgium,&mdash;she surviving the marriage only a year.
Her memory is kept alive by the gorgeous marble
cenotaph you will see in St. George’s Chapel,
Windsor.</p>

<p>It was only when George IV. actually ascended
the throne in 1820 that his separated wife put in
a disturbing appearance again; she had been living
very independently for some years on the Continent;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
and it occurred to her&mdash;now that George
was actually King&mdash;that it would be a good thing,
and not impinge on the old domestic frigidities, to
share in some of the drawing-room splendors and
royalties of the British capital. To George IV. it
seemed very awkward; so it did to his cabinet.
Hence came about those measures for a divorce,
and the famous trial of Queen Caroline, in which
Brougham won oratorical fame by his brilliant
plea for the Queen. This was so far successful as
to make the ministerial divorce scheme a failure;
but the poor Queen came out of the trial very
much bedraggled; whether her Continental life
had indeed its criminalities or not, we shall never
positively know. Surely no poor creature was
ever more sinned against than she, in being wheedled
into a match with such an unregenerate partaker
in all deviltries as George IV. But she was
not of the order of women out of which are made
martyrs for conscience’s sake. It was in the
year 1821 that death came to her relief, and her
shroud at last whitened a memory that had
stains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<h3>A Scholar and Poet.</h3>

<p>We freshen the air now with quite another presence.
Yet I am to speak of a man whose life was
full of tumult, and whose work was full of learning
and power&mdash;sometimes touched with infinite
delicacy.</p>

<p>He was born four years after Sydney Smith and
Walter Scott&mdash;both of whom he survived many
years; indeed he lacked only eleven years of completing
a century when he died in Florence, where
most of his active&mdash;or rather inactive&mdash;life was
passed. I allude to the poet and essayist, Walter
Savage Landor.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> He is not what is called a favorite
author; he never was; he never will be. In
fact, he had such scorn of popular applause, that
if it had ever happened to him in moments of
dalliance with the Muses, and of frolic with rhythmic
language, to set such music afloat as the world
would have repeated and loved to repeat, I think
he would have torn the music out in disdain for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the approval of a multitude. Hear what he says,
in one of his later poetic utterances:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Never was I impatient to receive</div>
<div class="verse">What <em>any</em> man could give me. When a friend</div>
<div class="verse">Gave me my due, I took it, and no more,</div>
<div class="verse">Serenely glad, because that friend was pleased.</div>
<div class="verse">I seek not many; many seek not me.</div>
<div class="verse">If there are few now seated at my board,</div>
<div class="verse">I pull no children’s hair because they munch</div>
<div class="verse">Gilt gingerbread, the figured and the sweet,</div>
<div class="verse">Or wallow in the innocence of whey;</div>
<div class="verse">Give <em>me</em> wild boar, the buck’s broad haunch give <em>me</em>,</div>
<div class="verse">And wine that time has mellowed, even as time</div>
<div class="verse">Mellows the warrior hermit in his cell.”<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Such verse does not invite a large following,
nor did the man. Pugnacious, tyrannic, loud-mouthed,
setting the world’s and the Church’s
rubrics at defiance; yet weighing language to the
last jot and tittle of its significance, and&mdash;odd-whiles&mdash;putting
little tendernesses of thought and
far-reaching poetic aspirations into such cinctures
of polished verse&mdash;so jewelled, so compact,
so classic, so fine&mdash;that their music will last and
be admired as long, I think, as English speech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
lasts. Apart from all this man wrote, there is a
strange, half-tragic interest in his life, which will
warrant me in telling you more of him than I
have told of many whose books are more prized
by you.</p>

<p>He was the son of a Dr. Landor, of Warwick,
in middle England, who by reason of two adroit
marriages was a man of fortune, and so secured
eventually a very full purse to the poet, who if he
had depended only on the sale of his literary
wares, would have starved. Language was always
young Landor’s hobby; and he came, by dint of
good schooling, to such dexterity in the use of
Latin, as to write it in verse or prose with nearly
the same ease as English. He loved out-of-door
pursuits in boyhood and all his life; was greatly
accomplished, his biographer says, in fishing&mdash;especially
with a cast-net; and of the prey that
sometimes came into such net there is this
frolicsome record:</p>

<div class="verse">“In youth ’twas there I used to scare</div>

<div class="verse">Where alders lean above the brook,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>

<p>At Oxford he was a marked man for his cleverness
and for his audacities; these last brought
him to grief there, and going home upon his
rustication, he quarrelled with his father. Thereafter
we find him in London, where he publishes
his first little booklet of poems (1795); only
twenty then; counted a fierce radical; detesting
old George III. with his whole heart; admiring
the rebel George Washington and declaring it;
loving the French, too, with their liberty and
fraternity song, until it was silenced by the
cannonading of Napoleon; thenceforward, he
counts that people a nation of “monkeys, fit only
to be chained.”</p>

<p>But Landor never loved London. We find him
presently wandering by the shores of Wales, and
among its mountains. Doubtless he takes his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
cast-net with him; the names of Ianthé and
Ioné decorate occasional verses; a certain Rose
Aylmer he encounters, too, who loans him a book
(by Clara Reeve), from a sketch in which he
takes hint for his wild, weird poem of <cite>Gebir</cite>, his
first long poem&mdash;known to very few&mdash;perhaps
not worth the knowing. It is blind in its drift;
war and pomp and passion in it&mdash;ending with a
poisoned cup; and contrasting with these, such
rural beatitudes as may be conjured under Afric
skies, with tender love-breezes, ending in other
beatitudes in coral palaces beneath the sea. This,
at any rate, is the phantasmic outline which a
reading leaves upon my own memory. Perhaps
another reader may be happier.</p>

<p>That shadowy Rose Aylmer, through whom the
suggestion for the poem came, was the real daughter
of Lord Aylmer, of the near Welsh country;
what Landor’s intimacy with her may have been, in
its promise or its reach, we do not know; but we
do know that when she died, somewhat later and
in a far country, the poet gave her name embalmment
in those wonderful little verses, which poor
Charles Lamb, it is said, in his later days, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
repeat over and over and over, never tiring of the
melody and the pathos. Here they are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Ah, what avails the sceptred race,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Ah, what the form divine!</div>
<div class="verse">What&mdash;every virtue, every grace!</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Rose Aylmer, all were thine.</div>
<div class="verse">Rose Aylmer, whom these wakeful eyes</div>
<div class="verse indent1">May weep, but never see,</div>
<div class="verse">A night of memories and of sighs</div>
<div class="verse indent1">I consecrate to thee!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Meantime, growing into a tempestuous love for
the wild Welsh country, he bargains for a great
estate, far up in a valley which opens down upon
the larger valley in which lies Abergavenny; and
being rich now by reason of his father’s death,
parts with his beautiful ancestral properties in the
Warwickshire region, lavishing a large portion
of the sales-money upon the savagery of the new
estate in Wales. He plants, he builds, he plays
the monarch in those solitudes. He marries, too,
while this mountain passion is on him, a young
girl of French or Swiss extraction&mdash;led like a
lamb into the lion’s grasp. But the first Welsh
quarrel of this poet-monarch&mdash;who was severely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
classic, and who fed himself all his life through
on the thunder-bolts of Jupiter&mdash;was with his
neighbors; next with his workmen; then with
his tenants; then the magistrates; last with everybody;
and in a passion of disgust, he throws
down his walls, turns astray his cattle, lets loose
his mountain tarns, and leaving behind him the
weltering wreck of his half-built home, goes over
with his wife to Jersey, off the coast of Normandy.
There she, poor, tired, frighted, worried bird&mdash;maybe
with a little of the falcon in her&mdash;would
stay; <em>he</em> would not. So he dashes on incontinently&mdash;deserting
her, and planting himself in
mid-France at the old city of Tours, where he devotes
himself to study.</p>

<p>This first family tiff, however, gets its healing,
and&mdash;his wife joining him&mdash;they go to Como,
where Southey (1817) paid them a visit; this poet
had been one of the first and few admirers of
<cite>Gebir</cite>, which fact softened the way to very much
of mutual and somewhat over-strained praises
between these two.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> From Como Landor went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Pisa&mdash;afterward to Florence, his home thenceforth
for very many years; first in the town proper and
then in a villa at Fiesole from which is seen that
wondrous view&mdash;none can forget who have beheld
it&mdash;of the valley, which seems a plain&mdash;of the
nestling city, with its great Brunelleschi dome,
its arrow-straight belfry of Giotto, its quaint tower
of the Palazzo Vecchio, its cypress sentinels on the
Boboli heights, its River Arno shining and winding,
and stealing away seaward from the amphitheatre
of hills&mdash;on whose slopes are dotted white
convents, sleeping in the sun, and villas peeping
out from their cloakings of verdure, and the gray
shimmer of olive orchards.</p>

<h3>Landor in Italy.</h3>

<p>It was in Florence that Landor wrote the greater
part of those <cite>Imaginary Conversations</cite> which have
given him his chief fame; but which, very possibly,
may be outlived in the popular mind by the
wonderful finish and the Saxon force which belong
to many of his verselets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>The conversations are just what their name
implies&mdash;the talk of learned, or distinguished
men, on such topics as they were supposed to be
most familiar with; all <em>imagined</em>, and set forth
by the brain of Landor, who took a strange
delight in thus playing with the souls of other
men and making them the puppets of his will.
One meets in his pages Roger Ascham and Lady
Jane Grey, Milton and Andrew Marvel, and
Achilles and Helena; then we are transported
from Mount Ida to the scene of a homely colloquy
between Washington and Franklin&mdash;about monarchy
and Republicanism. Again we have Leofric
and Godiva telling their old story with a touching
dramatic interest; and can listen&mdash;if we will&mdash;to
long and dullish dispute between Dr. Johnson
and Horne Tooke, about Language and its Laws;
from this&mdash;in which Landor was always much
interested&mdash;we slip to the Philo-Russianism of a
talk between Peter the Great and Alexis. There
are seven great volumes of it all&mdash;which must
belong to all considerable libraries, private or
other, and which are apt to keep very fresh and
uncut. Of course there is no logical continuity&mdash;no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
full exposition of a creed, or a faith, or a
philosophy. It is a great, wide, eloquent, homely
jumble; one bounces from rock to rock, or
from puddle to puddle (for there are puddles)
at the will of this great giant driver of the
chariot of imaginary talk.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> There are beauties
of expression that fascinate one; there are sentences
so big with meaning as to bring you to
sudden pause; there are wearisome chapters about
the balance of French verselets, in which he sets
up the poor Abbé Delille on rhetorical stilts&mdash;only
to pelt him down; there are page-long
blotches of crude humor, and irrelevant muddy
tales, that you wish were out. As sample of his
manner, I give one or two passages at random.
Speaking of Boileau, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In Boileau there is really more of diffuseness than of
brevity [he loves thus to slap a popular belief straight in
the face]; few observe this, because [Boileau] abounds in
short sentences; and few are aware that sentences may be
very short, and the writer very prolix; as half a dozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
stones rising out of a brook give the passenger more trouble
than a plank across it.” [He abounds in short, pert similes
of this sort which seem almost to carry an argument in
them.]</p>

<p>[Again] “Caligula spoke justly and admirably when he
compared the sentences of Seneca <em>to sand without lime</em>.”</p>

<p>[And once more] “He must be a bad writer, or, however,
a very indifferent one, to whom there are no inequalities.
The plants of such table-land are diminutive and never
worth gathering.… The vigorous mind has mountains
to climb and valleys to repose in. Is there any sea
without its shoal? On that which the poet navigates, he
rises intrepidly as the waves riot around him, and sits composedly
as they subside.…”</p>

<p>“Level the Alps one with another, and where is their
sublimity? Raise up the Vale of Tempe to the downs
above, and where are those sylvan creeks and harbors in
which the imagination watches while the soul reposes, those
recesses in which the gods partook of the weaknesses of
mortals, and mortals the enjoyments of the gods.”</p>

</div>

<p>The great learning of Landor and his vast information,
taken in connection with his habits of
self-indulgence (often of indolence), assure us
that he must have had the rare talent, and the
valuable one, of riddling books&mdash;that is, of skimming
over them&mdash;with such wonderfully quick
exercise of wit and judgment as to segregate the
valuable from the valueless parts. ’Tis not a bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
quality; nor is it necessarily (as many suppose)
attended by superficiality. The superficial man
does indeed skim things; but he pounces as
squarely and surely upon the bad as upon the
good; he works by mechanical process and progression&mdash;here
a sentence and there a sentence;
but the man who can race through a book well (as
did Dr. Johnson and Landor), carries to the work&mdash;in
his own genius for observation and quick
discernment&mdash;a chemical mordant that bites and
shows warning effervescence, and a signal to stay,
only where there is something strong to bite.</p>

<h3>Landor’s Domesticities.</h3>

<p>Meanwhile, we have a sorry story to tell of
Landor’s home belongings. There is a storm
brewing in that beautiful villa of Fiesole. Children
have been born to the house, and he pets
them, fondles them&mdash;seems to love them absorbingly.
Little notelets which pass when they are
away, at Naples, at Rome, are full of pleasantest
paternal banter and yearning. But those children
have run wild and are as vagrant as the winds.</p>

<p>The home compass has no fixed bearings and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
points all awry&mdash;the mother, never having sympathy
with the work which had tasked Landor in
those latter years, has, too, her own outside vanities
and a persistent petulance, which breaks out
into rasping speech when Jupiter flings his thunder-bolts.
So Landor, in a strong rage of determination,
breaks away: turns his back on wife and
children&mdash;providing for them, however, generously&mdash;and
goes to live again at Bath, in England.</p>

<p>For twenty-three years he stays there, away
from his family (remembering, perhaps, in self-exculpating
way, how Shakespeare had once done
much the same), rambling over his old haunts,
writing new verse, revamping old books, petting
his Pomeranian dog, entertaining admiring guests,
fuming and raving when crossed. He was more
dangerously loud, too, than of old; and at last is
driven away, to escape punishment for some scathing
libels into which a storm of what he counted
righteous rage has betrayed him. It must have
been a pitiful thing to see this old, white-haired
man&mdash;past eighty now&mdash;homeless, as good as
childless, skulking, as it were, in London, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
before sailing for the Continent,&mdash;appearing suddenly
at Forster’s house, seated upon his bed
there, with Dickens in presence, mumbling about
Latin poetry and its flavors!</p>

<p>He finds his way to Genoa, then to Florence,
then to the Fiesole Villa once more; but it would
seem as if there were no glad greetings on either
side; and in a few days estrangement comes again,
and he returns to Florence. Twice or thrice more
those visits to Fiesole are repeated, in the vague
hope, it would seem, floating in the old man’s
mind, that by some miracle of heaven, aspects
would change there&mdash;or perhaps in him&mdash;and
black grow white, and gloom sail away under
some new blessed gale from Araby. But it does
never come; nor ever the muddied waters of that
home upon the Florentine hills flow pure and
bright again.</p>

<h3>Final Exile and Death.</h3>

<p>He goes back&mdash;eighty-five now&mdash;toothless, and
trembling under weight of years and wranglings,
to the Via Nunziatina, in Florence; he has no
means now&mdash;having despoiled himself for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
benefit of those living at his Villa of Fiesole, who
will not live with him, or he with them; he is
largely dependent upon a brother in England.
He passes a summer, in these times, with the
American sculptor Story. He receives occasional
wandering friends; has a new pet of a dog to
fondle.</p>

<p>There is always a trail of worshipping women
and poetasters about him to the very last; but the
bad odor of his Bath troubles has followed him;
Normanby, the British Minister, will give him no
recognition; but there is no bending, no flinching
in this great, astute, imperious, headstrong, ill-balanced
creature. Indeed, he carries now under
his shock of white hair, and in his tottering figure,
a stock of that coarse virility which has distinguished
him always&mdash;which for so many has its
charm, and which it is hard to reconcile with the
tender things of which he was capable;&mdash;for instance,
that interview of Agamemnon and Iphigenia&mdash;so
cunningly, delicately, and so feelingly
told&mdash;as if the story were all his own, and had no
Greek root&mdash;other than what found hold in the
greensward of English Warwickshire. And I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
close our talk of Landor, by citing this: Iphigenia
has heard her doom (you know the story); she
must die by the hands of the priest&mdash;or, the
ships, on which her father’s hopes and his fortunes
rest, cannot sail. Yet, she pleads;&mdash;there may
have been mistakes in interpreting the cruel oracle,&mdash;there
may be hope still,&mdash;</p>

<h3>Prose of Leigh Hunt.</h3>

<p>It was some two years before George IV. came
to the Regency, and at nearly the same date
with the establishment of Murray’s <cite>Quarterly</cite>,
that Mr. Leigh Hunt,<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> in company with his
brother John Hunt, set up a paper called the
<cite>Examiner</cite>&mdash;associated in later days with the
strong names of Fonblanque and Forster. This
paper was of a stiffly Whiggish and radical sort,
and very out-spoken&mdash;so that when George IV.,
as Regent, seemed to turn his back on old Whig
friends, and show favors to the Tories (as he did),
Mr. Leigh Hunt wrote such sneering and abusive
articles about the Regent that he was prosecuted,
fined, and clapped into prison, where he
stayed two years. They were lucky two years
for him&mdash;making reputation for his paper and
for himself; his friends and family dressed up
his prison room with flowers (he loved overmuch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
little luxuries of that sort); Byron, Moore, Godwin,
and the rest all came to see him; and there
he caught the first faint breezes of that popular
applause which blew upon him in a desultory and
rather languid way for a good many years afterward&mdash;not
wholly forsaking him when he had
grown white-haired, and had brought his delicate,
fine, but somewhat feeble pen into the modern
courts of criticism.</p>

<p>I do not suppose that anybody in our day goes
into raptures over the writings of Leigh Hunt;
nevertheless, we must bring him upon our record&mdash;all
the more since there was American blood in
him. His father, Isaac Hunt, was born in the Barbadoes,
and studied in Philadelphia; in the latter
city, Dr. Franklin and Tom Paine used to be
visitors at his grandfather’s house. At the outbreak
of the Revolution, Hunt’s father, who&mdash;notwithstanding
his Philadelphia wife&mdash;was a
bitter loyalist, went to England&mdash;his departure
very much quickened by some threats of punishing
his aggressive Toryism. He appears in England
as a clergyman&mdash;ultimately wedded to
Unitarian doctrines; finding his way sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
to the studio of Benjamin West&mdash;talking over
Pennsylvania affairs with that famous artist, and
encountering there, as it chanced, John Trumbull,
a student in painting&mdash;who in after years
bequeathed an art-gallery to Yale College. It
happens, too, that this Colonel Trumbull, in 1812,
when the American war was in progress, was
suspected as a spy, and escaped grief mainly by
the intervention of Isaac Hunt.</p>

<p>The young Hunt began early to write&mdash;finding
his way into journalism of all sorts; his name associated
sooner or later with <cite>The News</cite>, and dramatic
critiques; with the <cite>Examiner</cite>, the <cite>Reflector</cite>,
the <cite>Indicator</cite>, the <cite>Companion</cite>, and the <cite>Liberal</cite>&mdash;for
which latter he dragged his family down into
Italy at the instance of Byron or Shelley, or both.
That <cite>Liberal</cite> was intended to astonish people and
make the welkin ring; but the Italian muddle
was a bad one, the <cite>Liberal</cite> going under, and
an ugly quarrel setting in; Hunt revenging himself
afterward by writing <cite>Lord Byron and his
Contemporaries</cite>,&mdash;a book he ultimately regretted:
he was never strong enough to make his bitterness
respected. Honeyed words became him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
better; and these he dealt out&mdash;wave upon
wave&mdash;on all sorts of unimportant themes.
Thus, he writes upon “Sticks”; and again upon
“Maid-servants”; again on “Bees and Butterflies”
(which is indeed very pretty); and again “Upon
getting up of a cold morning”&mdash;in which he
compassionates those who are haled out of their
beds by “harpy-footed furies”&mdash;discourses on his
own experience and sees his own breath rolling
forth like smoke from a chimney, and the windows
frosted over.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Then the servant comes in: ‘It is very cold this morning,
is it not?’ ‘Very cold, sir.’ ‘Very cold, indeed, isn’t
it?’ ‘Very cold, indeed, sir.’ ‘More than usually so, isn’t
it, even for this weather?’ ‘Why, sir, I think it <em>is</em>, sir.’… And
then the hot water comes: ‘And is it quite
hot? And isn’t it too hot?’ And what ‘an unnecessary and
villainous custom this is of shaving.’”</p>

</div>

<p>Whereupon he glides off, in words that flow as
easily as water from a roof&mdash;into a disquisition
upon flowing beards&mdash;instancing Cardinal Bembo
and Michelangelo, Plato and the Turks. Listen
again to what he has to say in his <cite>Indicator</cite> upon
“A Coach”:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is full of cushions and comfort; elegantly colored inside
and out; rich yet neat; light and rapid, yet substantial.
The horses seem proud to draw it. The fat and fair-wigged
coachman lends his sounding lash, his arm only in action,
and that but little; his body well set with its own weight.
The footman, in the pride of his nonchalance, holding by
the straps behind, and glancing down sideways betwixt his
cocked hat and neckcloth, standing swinging from East to
West upon his springy toes. The horses rush along amidst
their glancing harness. Spotted dogs leap about them, barking
with a princely superfluity of noise. The hammer cloth
trembles through all its fringe. The paint flashes in the
sun.”</p>

</div>

<p>Nothing can be finer&mdash;if one likes that sort of
fineness. We follow such a writer with no sense
of his having addressed our intellectual nature,
but rather with a sense of pleasurable regalement
to our nostrils by some high wordy perfume.</p>

<p>Hawthorne, in <cite>Our Old Home</cite>, I think, tells us
that even to extreme age, the boyishness of the
man’s nature shone through and made Hunt’s
speech like the chirp of a bird; he never tired of
gathering his pretty roses of words. It is hard to
think of such a man doing serious service in the
role of radical journalist&mdash;as if he <em>could</em> speak
dangerous things! And yet, who can tell? They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
say Robespierre delighted in satin facings to his
coat, and was never without his <i lang="fr">boutonnière</i>.</p>

<p>We all know the figure of Harold Skimpole, in
Dickens’s <cite>Bleak House</cite>, with traits so true to Leigh
Hunt’s, that the latter’s friends held up a warning
finger, and said: “For shame!” to the novelist.
Indeed, I think Dickens felt relentings in his
later years, and would have retouched the portrait;
but a man who paints with flesh and blood
pigments cannot retouch.</p>

<p>Certain it is that the household of Hunt was of
a ram-shackle sort, and he and his always very
much out at ends. Even Carlyle, who was a
neighbor at Chelsea, was taken aback at the easy
way in which Hunt confronted the butcher-and-baker
side of life; and the kindly Mrs. Carlyle
drops a half-querulous mention of her shortened
larder and the periodic borrowings of the excellent
Mrs. Hunt.</p>

<h3>Hunt’s Verse.</h3>

<p>But over all this we stretch a veil now, woven
out of the little poems that he has left. He
wrote no great poems, to be sure; for here, as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
his prose, he is earnestly bent on carving little
baskets out of cherry-stones&mdash;little figures on
cherry-stones&mdash;dainty hieroglyphics, but always
on cherry-stones!</p>

<p>His “Rimini,” embodying that old Dantesque
story about Giovanni and Paolo and Francesca, is
his longest poem. There are exceedingly pretty
and delicate passages in it; I quote one or two:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“For leafy was the road with tall array</div>
<div class="verse">On either side of mulberry and bay,</div>
<div class="verse">And distant snatches of blue hills between;</div>
<div class="verse">And there the alder was, with its bright green,</div>
<div class="verse">And the broad chestnut, and the poplar’s shoot</div>
<div class="verse">That, like a feather, waves from head to foot;</div>
<div class="verse">With ever and anon majestic pines;</div>
<div class="verse">And still, from tree to tree, the early vines</div>
<div class="verse">Hung, garlanding the way in amber lines.</div>
<div class="verse center">…</div>
<div class="verse">And then perhaps you entered upon shades,</div>
<div class="verse">Pillowed with dells and uplands ’twixt the glades</div>
<div class="verse">Through which the distant palace, now and then,</div>
<div class="verse">Looked forth with many windowed ken&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">A land of trees which, reaching round about,</div>
<div class="verse">In shady blessing stretched their old arms out</div>
<div class="verse">With spots of sunny opening, and with nooks</div>
<div class="verse">To lie and read in&mdash;sloping into brooks,</div>
<div class="verse">Where at her drink you started the slim deer,</div>
<div class="verse">Retreating lightly with a lovely fear.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
<div class="verse">And all about the birds kept leafy house,</div>
<div class="verse">And sung and sparkled in and out the boughs,</div>
<div class="verse">And all about a lovely sky of blue</div>
<div class="verse">Clearly was felt, or down the leaves laughed through.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And so on&mdash;executed with ever so much of delicacy&mdash;but
not a sign or a symbol of the grave and
melancholy tone which should equip, even to the
utmost hem of its descriptive passages, that tragic
story of Dante.</p>

<p>Those deft, little feathery touches&mdash;about deer,
and birds, and leafy houses, are not scored with
the seriousness which in every line and pause
should be married with the intensity of the
story. The painting of Mr. Watts, of the dead
Francesca&mdash;ghastly though it be&mdash;has more in
it to float one out into the awful current of
Dante’s story than a world of the happy wordy
meshes of Mr. Hunt. A greater master would
have brought in, maybe, all those natural beauties
of the landscape&mdash;the woods, the fountains, the
clear heaven&mdash;but they would all have been toned
down to the low, tragic movement, which threatens,
and creeps on and on, and which dims even
the blue sky with forecast of its controlling gloom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no such inaptness or inadequacy where
Leigh Hunt writes of crickets and grasshoppers
and musical boxes. In his version of the old classic
story of “Hero and Leander,” however, the impertinence
(if I may be pardoned the language) of
his dainty wordy dexterities is even more strikingly
apparent. <em>His</em> Hero, waiting for her Leander,
beside the Hellespont,</p>

<p>No&mdash;this is not a Greek maiden listening for
the surge of the water before the stalwart swimmer

poet has seen in a second-story back window, meditating

<h3>An Irish Poet.</h3>

<p>Among those who paid their visits of condolence
to Leigh Hunt in the days of his prisonhood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
was Moore<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> the author of <cite>Lalla Rookh</cite> and of <cite>The
Loves of the Angels</cite>. He was not used to paying
visits in such quarters, for he had an instinctive
dislike for all uncanny things and disagreeable
places; nor was he ever a great friend of Hunt;
but he must have had a good deal of sympathy
with him in that attack upon the Prince Regent
which brought about Hunt’s conviction. Moore,
too, had his gibes at the Prince&mdash;thinking that
great gentleman had been altogether too neglectful
of the dignities of his high estate; but he was
very careful that his gibes should be so modulated
as not to put their author in danger.</p>

<p><cite>Lalla Rookh</cite> may be little read nowadays; but
not many years have passed since this poem
and others of the author’s used to get into the
finest of bindings, and have great currency for
bridal and birthday gifts. Indeed, there is a
witching melody in Moore’s Eastern tales, and a
delightful shimmer and glitter of language, which
none but the most cunning of our present craft-masters
in verse could reach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Moore was born in Dublin, his father having
kept a wine-shop there; and his mother (he tells
us) was always anxious about the quality of his
companions, and eager to build up his social standing&mdash;an
anxiety which was grafted upon the poet
himself, and which made him one of the wariest,
and most coy and successful of society-seekers&mdash;all
his life.</p>

<p>He was at the Dublin University&mdash;took easily
to languages, and began spinning off some of
<cite>Anacreon’s</cite> numbers into graceful English, even
before he went up to London&mdash;on his old
mother’s savings&mdash;to study law at the Temple.
He was charmingly presentable in those
days; very small, to be sure, but natty, courteous,
with a pretty modesty, and a voice that
bubbled over into music whenever he recited
one of his engaging snatches of melody. He has
letters to Lords, too, and the most winning of
tender speeches and smiles for great ladies. He
comes to an early interview with the Prince of
Wales&mdash;who rather likes the graceful Irish
singer, and flatters him by accepting the dedication
of <cite>Anacreon</cite> with smiles of condescension&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Mr. Moore perhaps counted too largely upon.
Never had a young literary fellow of humble birth
a better launch upon London society. His Lords’
letters, and his pretty conciliatory ways, get him
a place of value (when scarce twenty-four) in
Bermuda. But he is not the man to lose his
hold on London; so he goes over seas only to put
a deputy in place, and then, with a swift run
through our Atlantic cities, is back again. It is
rather interesting to read now what the young
poet says of us in those green days:&mdash;In Philadelphia,
it appears, the people quite ran after him:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I was much caressed while there.… and two or
three little poems, of a very flattering kind, some of their
choicest men addressed to me.” [And again.] “Philadelphia
is the only place in America which can boast any
literary society.” [Boston people, I believe, never admired
Moore overmuch.]</p>

</div>

<p>Here again is a bit from his diary at Ballston&mdash;which
was the Saratoga of that day:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There were about four hundred people&mdash;all stowed in a
miserable boarding-house. They were astonished at our
asking for basons and towels in our rooms; and thought we
might condescend to come down to the Public Wash, with
the other gentlemen, in the morning.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>Poor, dainty, Moore! But he is all right when
he comes back to London, and gives himself to
old occupations of drawing-room service, and to
the coining of new, and certainly very sweet and
tender, Irish melodies. He loved to be tapped on
the shoulder by great Dowagers, sparkling in
diamonds, and to be entreated&mdash;“Now, dear
Mr. Moore, <em>do</em> sing us one more song.”</p>

<p>And it was pretty sure to come: he delighted
in giving his very feeling and musical voice range
over the heads of fine-feathered women. The
peacock’s plumes, the shiver of the crystal, the
glitter of Babylon, always charmed him.</p>

<p>Nor was it all only tinkling sound that he gave
back. For proof I cite one or two bits:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Then I sing the wild song, ’twas once such a pleasure to hear,</div>
<div class="verse">When our voices commingling breathed, like one, on the ear;</div>
<div class="verse">And, as Echo far off thro’ the vale, my sad orison rolls,</div>
<div class="verse">I think, O my love! ’tis thy voice from the Kingdom of Souls</div>
<div class="verse">Faintly answering still the notes that once were so dear.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Dear Harp of my Country! farewell to thy numbers,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">This sweet wreath of song is the last we shall twine.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Go sleep, with the Sunshine of Fame on thy slumbers,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Till touched by some hand less unworthy than mine.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“If the pulse of the patriot, soldier, or lover</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Have throbbed at our lay, ’tis thy glory alone;</div>
<div class="verse">I was <em>but</em> as the wind, passing heedlessly over,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And all the wild sweetness I wak’d was thy own.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is better than dynamite to stir Ireland’s
best pulses, even now.</p>

<h3>Lalla Rookh.</h3>

<p>Mr. Moore had his little country vacations&mdash;among
them, that notable stay up in the lovely
county of Derbyshire, near to Ashbourne and
Dovedale, and the old fishing grounds of Walton
and of Cotton&mdash;where he wrote the larger part
of his first considerable poem, <cite>Lalla Rookh</cite>&mdash;which
had amazing success, and brought to its
author the sum of £3,000. But I do not think
that what inspiration is in it came to him from
the hollows or the heights of Derbyshire; I
should rather trace its pretty Oriental confusion
of sound and scenes to the jingle of London chandeliers.
Yet the web, the gossamer, the veils and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the flying feet do not seem to touch ground anywhere
in England, but shift and change and grow
out of his Eastern readings and dreams.</p>

<p>Moore married at thirty-two&mdash;after he was
known for the Irish melodies, but before the publication
of <cite>Lalla Rookh</cite>; and in his <cite>Letters and
Diary</cite> (if you read them&mdash;though they make an
enormous mass to read, and frighten most people
away by their bulk), you will come upon very frequent,
and very tender mention of “Dear Bessie”&mdash;the
wife. It is true, there were rumors that he
wofully neglected her, but hardly well founded.
Doubtless there was many a day and many a week
when she was guarding the cottage and the children
at Sloperton; and he bowing and pirouetting his
way amongst the trailing robes of their ladyships
who loved music and literature in London; but
how should he refuse the invitations of his Lordship
this or that? Or how should she&mdash;who
has no robes that will stand alone&mdash;bring her
pretty home gowns into that blazon of the salons?
Always, too (if his letters may be trusted), he is
eager to make his escape between whiles&mdash;wearied
of this <i lang="fr">tintamarre</i>&mdash;and to rush away to his cottage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
at Sloperton<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> for a little slippered ease, and
a romp with the children. Poor children&mdash;they
all drop away, one by one&mdash;two only reaching
maturity&mdash;then dying. The pathetic stories of
the sickening, the danger and the hush, come
poignantly into his Diary, and it does seem that
the winning clatter of the world gets a hold upon
his wrenched heart over-quickly again. But what
right have you or I to judge in such matters?</p>

<p>There are chirrupy little men&mdash;and women,
too,&mdash;on whom grief does not seem to take a hard
grip; all the better for them! Moore, I think,
was such a one, and was braced up always and
everywhere by his own healthy pulses, and, perhaps,
by a sense of his own sufficiency. His vanities
are not only elastic, but&mdash;by his own bland
and child-like admissions&mdash;they seem sometimes
almost monumental. He writes in his <cite>Diary</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
“Shiel (that’s an Irish friend) says I am the first
poet of the day, and join the beauty of the Bird-of-Paradise’s
plumes to the strength of the eagle’s
wing.” Fancy a man copying that sort of thing
into his own <cite>Diary</cite>, and regaling himself with it!</p>

<p>Yet he is full of good feeling&mdash;does not cherish
resentments&mdash;lets who will pat him on the shoulder
(though he prefers a lord’s pat). Then he
forgives injuries or slights grandly; was once so
out with Jeffrey that a duel nearly came of it; but
afterward was his hail-fellow and good friend for
years. Sometimes he shows a magnanimous strain&mdash;far
more than his artificialities of make-up
would seem to promise. Thus, being at issue with
the publisher, John Murray (a long-dated difference),
he determines on good advisement to be away
with it; and so goes smack into the den of the
great publisher and gives him his hand: such action
balances a great deal of namby-pambyism.</p>

<p>But what surprises more than all about Moore,
is the very great reputation that he had in his
day. We, in these latter times, have come to
reckon him (rather rashly, perhaps) only an arch
gossipper of letters&mdash;a butterfly of those metropolitan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
gardens&mdash;easy, affable, witty, full of
smiles, full of good feeling, full of pretty little
rhythmical utterances&mdash;singing songs as easy as a
sky-lark (and leaving the sky thereafter as empty);
planting nothing that lifts great growth, or tells
larger tale than lies in his own lively tintinnabulation
of words.</p>

<p>Yet Byron said of him: “There is nothing
Moore may not do, if he sets about it.” Sydney
Smith called him “A gentleman of small stature,
but full of genius, and a steady friend of all that
is honorable.” Leigh Hunt says: “I never received
a visit from him, but I felt as if I had been
talking with Prior or Sir Charles Sedley.” It is
certain that he must have been a most charming
companion. Walter Scott says: “It would be a
delightful addition to life if Thomas Moore had a
cottage within two miles of me.” Indeed, he was
always quick to scent anything that might amuse,
and to store it up. His diaries overflow with
these bright specks and bits of talk, which may
kindle a laugh, but do not nestle in the memory.</p>

<p>But considered as a poet whose longish work
ought to live and charm the coming generations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
his reputation certainly does not hold to the old
illuminated heights. Poems of half a century
ago, which <cite>Lalla Rookh</cite> easily outshone, have
now put the pretty orientalisms into shade. Nor
can we understand how so many did, and do, put
such twain of verse-makers as Byron and Moore
into one leash, as if they were fellows in power.
In the comparison the author of the <cite>Loves of the
Angels</cite> seems to me only a little important-looking,
kindly pug&mdash;nicely combed, with ribbons
about the neck&mdash;in an embroidered blanket, with
jingling bells at its corners; and Byron&mdash;beside
him&mdash;a lithe, supple leopard, with a tread that
threatens and a dangerous glitter in the eye.
Milk diet might sate that other; but this one,
if occasion served, would lap blood.</p>

<p>In the pages that follow we shall, among others,
more or less notable, encounter again that lithe
leopard in some of his wanton leaps&mdash;into verse,
into marriage, into exile, and into the pit of death
at Missolonghi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">We opened our budget in the last chapter
with the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>, which was
just getting upon its legs through the smart,
keen, and hard writing of Mr. William Gifford.
It throve afterward under the coddling of the
most literary of the Tory gentlemen in London,
and its title has always been associated with the
names of John Wilson Croker, of Dr. Southey,
and of Mr. Lockhart. It is a journal, too, which
has always been tied by golden bonds to the worship
of tradition and of vested privilege, and
which has always been ready with its petulant,
impatient bark of detraction at reform or reformers,
or at any books which may have had
a scent of Liberalism. Leigh Hunt, of course,
came in for periodic scathings&mdash;some of them deserved;
some not deserved. Indeed, I am half-disposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
to repent what may have seemed a too
flippant mention of this very graceful poet and
essayist. Of a surety, there is an abounding affluence
of easy language&mdash;gushing and disporting
over his pages&mdash;which lures one into reading and
into dreamy acquiescence; but read as much as
we may, and as long as we will, we shall go away
from the reading with a certain annoyance that
there is so little to keep out of it all&mdash;so little
that sticks to the ribs and helps.</p>

<p>As for the poet Moore, of whom also we may
have spoken in terms which may seem of too great
disparagement to those who have loved to linger
in his</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent13">“Vale of Cashmere</div>
<div class="verse indent1">With its roses, the brightest that earth ever gave.</div>
<div class="verse">Its temples, and grottos, and fountains as clear</div>
<div class="verse indent1">As the love-lighted eyes that hang over their wave,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">no matter what may become of these brilliant
orientalisms, or of his life of Byron, or of his
diaries, and his “Two-penny Post Bag,” it is certain
that his name will be gratefully kept alive by
his sparkling, patriotic, and most musical Irish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
melodies; and under that sufficient monument
we leave him.</p>

<p>As for Landor&mdash;surely the pages in which we
dealt with him were not too long: a strange,
strong bit of manhood&mdash;as of one fed on collops
of bear’s meat; a big animal nature, yet wonderfully
transfused by a vivid intellectuality&mdash;fine
and high&mdash;that pierced weighty subjects to their
core; and yet&mdash;and yet, singing such heart-shivering
tributes as that to Rose Aylmer: coarse
as the bumpkins on the sheep wolds of Lincoln,
and yet with as fine subtleties in him as belonged
to the young Greeks who clustered about the
writer of the <cite>Œdipus Tyrannus</cite>.</p>

<h3>The “First Gentleman.”</h3>

<p>King George IV. was an older man than any of
those we have commented on; indeed, he was a
prematurely old man at sixty-five&mdash;feeling the
shivers and the stings of his wild life: I suppose
no one ever felt the approaches of age more mortifyingly.
He had counted so much on being
the fine gentleman to the last&mdash;such a height,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
such a carriage, such a grace! It was a dark day
for him when his mirror showed wrinkles that his
cosmetics would not cover, and a stoop in the
shoulders which his tailors could not bolster out of
sight. Indeed, in his later years he shrunk from
exposure of his infirmities, and kept his gouty step
out of reach of the curious, down at Windsor,
where he built a cottage in a wood; and arranged
his drives through the Park so that those who had
admired this Apollo at his best should never know
of his shakiness. Thither went his conclave of
political advisers&mdash;sometimes Canning, the wonderful
orator&mdash;sometimes the Duke of Wellington,
with the honors of Waterloo upon him&mdash;sometimes
young Sir Robert Peel, just beginning to make his
influence felt; oftener yet, Charles Greville, whose
memoirs are full of piquant details about the royal
household&mdash;not forgetting that army of tailors
and hair-dressers who did their best to assuage
the misery and gratify the vanities of the gouty
king. And when he died&mdash;which he hated exceedingly
to do&mdash;in 1830, there came to light
such a multitude of waistcoats, breeches, canes,
snuff-boxes, knee-buckles, whips, and wigs, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
suppose were never heaped before around any
man’s remains. The first gentleman in Europe
could not, after all, carry these things with him.
His brother, William IV., who succeeded him, was
a bluff old Admiral&mdash;with not so high a sense of
the proprieties of life as George; but honester
even in his badnesses (which were very many) and,
with all his coarseness and vulgarity, carrying a
brusque, sailor-like frankness that half redeemed
his peccadilloes. In those stormy times which belonged
to the passage of the Reform Bill of 1832,
he showed nerve and pluck, and if he split the air
pretty often with his oaths, he never offended by
a wearying dilettanteism, or by foppery. In the
year 1837 he died; and then and there began&mdash;within
the memory of a good many of us old
stagers&mdash;that reign of his young niece Victoria,
daughter of his brother, the Duke of Kent (who
had died seventeen years before)&mdash;which reign
still continues, and is still resplendent with the
virtues of the Sovereign and the well-being of
her people.</p>

<p>Under these several royal hands, the traditional
helpfulness to men of letters had declared itself in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
pensions and civil appointments; Southey had
come to his laureateship, and his additional pension;
we found the venerable Wordsworth making
a London pilgrimage for a “kissing of hands,”
and the honor of a royal stipend; Walter Scott
had received his baronetcy at the hands of George
IV., and that dilettante sovereign would have
taken Byron (whom we shall presently encounter)
patronizingly by the hand, except the fiery poet&mdash;scenting
slights everywhere&mdash;had flamed up in
that spirit of proud defiance, which afterward declared
itself with a fury of denunciation in the
<cite>Irish Avatar</cite> (1821).</p>

<h3>Hazlitt and Hallam.</h3>

<p>Another noticeable author of this period, whose
cynicism kept him very much by himself, was
William Hazlitt;<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> he was the son of a clergyman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and very precocious&mdash;hearing Coleridge preach
in his father’s pulpit at Wem in Shropshire, and
feeling his ambition stirred by the notice of that
poet, who was attracted by the shrewd speech and
great forehead of the boy. Young Hazlitt drifts
away from such early influences to Paris and
to painting&mdash;he thinking to master that art. But
in this he does nothing satisfying; he next appears
in London, to carve a way to fame with his
pen. He is an acute observer; he is proud; he
is awkward; he is shy. Charles Lamb and sister
greatly befriend him and take to him; and he,
with his hate of conventionalisms, loves those
Lamb chambers and the whist parties, where he
can go, in whatever slouch costume he may choose;
poor Mary Lamb, too, perceiving that he has
a husband-ish hankering after a certain female
friend of hers&mdash;blows hot and cold upon it, in
her quaint little notelets, with a delighted and an
undisguised sense of being a party to their little
game. It ended in a marriage at last; not without
its domestic infelicities; but these would be
too long, and too dreary for the telling. Mr.
Hazlitt wrote upon a vast variety of topics&mdash;upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
art, and the drama, upon economic questions,
upon politics&mdash;as wide in his range as Leigh
Hunt; and though he was far more trenchant,
more shrewd, more disputatious, more thoughtful,
he did lack Hunt’s easy pliancy and grace of touch.
Though a wide reader and acute observer, Hazlitt
does not contend or criticise by conventional
rules; his law of measurement is not by old syntactic,
grammatic, or dialectic practices; there’s
no imposing display of critical implements (by
which some operators dazzle us), but he cuts&mdash;quick
and sharp&mdash;to the point at issue. We
never forget his strenuous, high-colored personality,
and the seething of his prejudices&mdash;whether
his talk is of Napoleon (in which he is not reverent
of average British opinion), or of Sir Joshua
Reynolds, or of Burke’s brilliant oratorical apostrophes.
But with fullest recognition of his acuteness,
and independence, there remains a disposition
(bred by his obstinacies and shortcomings)
to take his conclusions <i lang="la">cum grano salis</i>. He never
quite disabuses our mind of the belief that he is a
paid advocate; he never conquers by calm; and,
upon the whole, impresses one as a man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
found little worth the living for in this world,
and counted upon very little in any other.</p>

<p>The historian, Henry Hallam,<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> on the other
hand, who was another notable literary character of
this epoch, was full of all serenities of character&mdash;even
under the weight of such private griefs as were
appalling. He was studious, honest, staid&mdash;with
a great respect for decorum; he would have gravitated
socially&mdash;as he did&mdash;rather to Holland
House than to the chambers where Lamb presided
over the punch-bowl. In describing the man one
describes his histories; slow, calm, steady even to
prosiness, yet full; not entertaining in a gossipy
sense; not brilliant; scarce ever eloquent. If he
is in doubt upon a point he tells you so; if there
has been limitation to his research, there is no
concealment of it; I think, upon the whole, the
honestest of all English historians. In his search
for truth, neither party, nor tradition, nor religious
scruples make him waver. None can make
their historic journey through the Middle Ages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
without taking into account the authorities he
has brought to notice, and the path that he has
scored.</p>

<p>And yet there is no atmosphere along that path
as he traces it. People and towns and towers and
monarchs pile along it, clearly defined, but in dead
shapes. He had not the art&mdash;perhaps he would
have disdained the art&mdash;to touch all these with
picturesque color, and to make that page of the
world’s history glow and palpitate with life.</p>

<p>Among those great griefs which weighed upon
the historian, and to which allusion has been
made, I name that one only with which you are
perhaps familiar&mdash;I mean the sudden death of his
son Arthur, a youth of rare accomplishments&mdash;counted
by many of more brilliant promise than
any young Englishman of his time&mdash;yet snatched
from life, upon a day of summer’s travel, as by a
thunderbolt. He lies buried in Clevedon Church,
which overhangs the waters of Bristol Channel;
and his monument is Tennyson’s wonderful memorial
poem.</p>

<p>I will not quote from it; but cite only the lines
“out of which” (says Dr. John Brown), “as out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the well of the living waters of Love, flows forth
all <cite>In Memoriam</cite>.”</p>

<p>I have purposely set before you two strongly
contrasted types of English literary life in that
day&mdash;in William Hazlitt and Henry Hallam&mdash;the
first representing very nearly what we would
call the Bohemian element&mdash;ready to-day for an
article in the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>, and to-morrow
for a gibe in the <cite>Examiner</cite>, or a piece of diablerie

hand, representing the sober and orderly traditions,
colored by the life and work of such men
as Hume, Roscoe, and Gibbon.</p>

<h3>Queen of a Salon.</h3>

<p>Another group of literary people, of a very
varied sort, we should have found in the salons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
of my Lady Blessington,<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> who used to hold court
on the Thames&mdash;now by Piccadilly, and again at
Gore House&mdash;in the early part of this century.
She was herself a writer; nor is her personal history
without its significance, as an outgrowth of
times when George IV. was setting the pace for
those ambitious of social distinction.</p>

<p>She was the quick-witted daughter of an Irish
country gentleman of the Lucius O’Trigger sort&mdash;nicknamed
Beau Power. He loved a whip and
fast horses&mdash;also dogs, powder, and blare. He
wore white-topped boots, with showy frills and
ruffles; he drank hard, swore harder&mdash;wasted his
fortune, abused his wife, but was “very fine” to
the end. He was as cruel as he was fine; shot a
peasant once, in cold blood, and dragged him home
after his saddle beast. He worried his daughter,
Marguerite (Lady Blessington), into marrying,
at fifteen, a man whom she detested. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
gave relief, however, from paternal protection,
until the husband proved worse than the father,
and separation ensued&mdash;made good (after some
years of tumultuous, uneasy life) by the violent
and providential death of the recreant husband.
Shortly after, she married Lord Blessington, a rich
Irish nobleman, very much blasé, seven years
her senior, but kind and always generous with
her. Then came travel in a princely way over the
Continent, with long stays in pleasant places, and
such lavish spendings as put palaces at their disposal&mdash;of
all which a readable and gossipy record
is given in her <cite>Idler in Italy</cite> and <cite>Idler in France</cite>&mdash;books
well known, in their day, in America.
Of course she encountered in these ramblings
Landor, Shelley, Byron, and all notable Englishmen,
and when she returned to London it was to
establish that brilliant little court already spoken
of. She was admirably fitted for sovereign of
such a court; she was witty, ready, well-instructed;
was beautiful, too, and knew every
art of the toilet.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>More than this, she was mistress of all the
pretty and delicate arts of conciliation; had
amazing aptitude for accommodating herself to
different visitors&mdash;flattering men without letting
them know they were flattered&mdash;softening difficulties,
bringing enemies together, magnetizing
the most obstinate and uncivil into acquiescence
with her rules of procedure. Withal she had in
large development those Irish traits of generosity
and cheer, with a natural, winning way, which
she studied to make more and more taking. One
of those women who, with wit, prettiness, and
grace, count it the largest, as it is (to them) the
most agreeable duty of life, to be forever making
social conquests, and forever reaping the applause
of drawing-rooms. And if we add to the smiles
and the witty banter and the persuasive tones of
our lady, the silken hangings, the velvet carpets,
the mirrors multiplying inviting alcoves, with
paintings by Cattermole or Stothard, and marbles,
maybe by Chantrey or Westmacott, and music in
its set time by the best of London masters, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
cooking in its season as fine as the music,&mdash;and
we shall be at no loss to measure the attractions
of Gore House, and to judge of the literary and
social aspects which blazed there on the foggy
banks of the Thames. No wonder that old Samuel
Rogers, prince of epicures, should love to
carry his pinched face and his shrunk shanks into
such sunny latitudes. Moore, too, taking his
mincing steps into those regions, would find banquets
to remind him of the Bowers of Bendemeer.
Possibly, too, the Rev. Sydney Smith, without
the fear of Lady Holland in his heart or eyes,
may have pocketed his dignity as Canon of St.
Paul’s and gone thither to taste the delights of
the table or of the talk. Even Hallam, or
Southey (on his rare visits to town), may have
gone there. Lady Blessington was always keenly
awake for such arrivals. Even Brougham used to
take sometimes his clumsy presence to her brilliant
home; and so, on occasion, did that younger
politician, and accomplished gentleman, Sir Robert
Peel. Procter&mdash;better known as Barry Cornwall&mdash;the
song-writer, was sure to know his way
to those doors and to be welcomed; and Leigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Hunt was always eager to play off his fine speeches
amid such surroundings of wine and music.</p>

<p>The Comte d’Orsay, artist and man of letters,
who married (1827) a daughter of Lord Blessington
(step-daughter of the Countess), was a standing
ornament of the house; and rivalling him in
their cravats and other millinery were two young
men who had long careers before them. These
were Benjamin Disraeli and Edward Lytton Bulwer.</p>

<h3>Young Bulwer and Disraeli.</h3>

<p>It was some years before the passage of the Reform
bill, and before the death of George IV.,
that Bulwer<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> blazed out in <cite>Pelham</cite> (1828), <cite>The
Disowned</cite>, and <cite>Devereux</cite>, making conquest of the
novel-reading town, at a time when <cite>Quentin Durward</cite>
(1823) was not an old book, and <cite>Woodstock</cite><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
(1826) still fresh. And if Pelhamism had its
speedy subsidence, the same writer put such captivating
historic garniture and literary graces about
the Italian studies of <cite>Rienzi</cite>, and of the <cite>Last Days
of Pompeii</cite>, as carry them now into most libraries,
and insure an interested reading&mdash;notwithstanding
a strong sensuous taint and sentimental extravagances.</p>

<p>He had scholarship; he had indefatigable industry;
he had abounding literary ambitions and
enthusiasms, but he had no humor; I am afraid
he had not a very sensitive conscience; and he
had no such pervading refinement of literary
taste as to make his work serve as the exemplar
for other and honester workers.</p>

<p>Benjamin Disraeli<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> in those days overmatched
him in cravats and in waistcoats, and was the
veriest fop of all fop-land. No more beautiful
accessory could be imagined to the drawing-room
receptions over which Lady Blessington presided,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
and of which the ineffable Comte d’Orsay was a
shining and a fixed light, than this young Hebraic
scion of a great Judean house&mdash;whose curls were
of the color of a raven’s wing, and whose satin
trumpery was ravishing!</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;this young foppish Disraeli, within
fifty years, held the destinies of Great Britain in
his hand, and had endowed the Queen with the
grandest title she had ever worn&mdash;that of Empress
of India. Still further, in virtue of his old
friendship for his fellow fop Bulwer, he sends the
son of that novelist (in the person of the second
Lord Lytton) to preside over a nation numbering
two hundred millions of souls. Whoever can
accomplish these ends with such a people as that
of Great Britain must needs have something in
him beyond mere fitness for the pretty salons of
my Lady Blessington.</p>

<p>And what was it? Whatever you may count it,
there is surely warrant for telling you something
of his history and his antecedents: Three or
more centuries ago&mdash;at the very least&mdash;a certain
Jew of Cordova, in Spain, driven out by the
terrors of the Inquisition, went to Venice&mdash;established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
himself there in merchandise, and his family
throve there for two hundred years. A century
and a half ago,&mdash;when the fortunes of Venice
were plainly on the wane&mdash;the head of this Jewish
family&mdash;Benjamin Disraeli (grandfather of
the one of whom we speak) migrated to England.
This first English Benjamin met with success on
the Exchange of London, and owing to the influences
of his wife (who hated all Jewry) he discarded
his religious connection with Hebraism, went to
the town of Enfield, a little north of London&mdash;with
a good fortune, and lived there the life of a
retired country gentleman. He had a son Isaac,
who devoted himself to the study of literature,
and showed early strong bookish proclivities&mdash;very
much to the grief of his father, who had a
shrewd contempt for all such follies. Yet the
son Isaac persisted, and did little else through a
long life, save to prosecute inquiries about the
struggles of authors and the lives of authors
and the work of authors&mdash;all ending in that
agglomeration which we know as the <cite>Curiosities
of Literature</cite>&mdash;a book which sixty years since
used to be reckoned a necessary part of all well-equipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
libraries; but which&mdash;to tell truth&mdash;has
very little value; being without any method,
without fulness, and without much accuracy. It
is very rare that so poor a book gets so good a
name, and wears it so long.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, this father, who had devoted a
life to the mere gossip of literature, as it were,
warns his son Benjamin against literary pursuits
(he wrote three or four novels indeed,<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> but they
are never heard of), and the son studied mostly
under private tutors; there is no full or trustworthy
private biography of him: but we know
that in the years 1826-1827&mdash;only a short time
before the Lady Blessington coterie was in its best
feather&mdash;he wrote a novel called <cite>Vivian Grey</cite>,&mdash;the
author being then under twenty-two&mdash;which
for a time divided attention with <cite>Pelham</cite>. In club
circles it made even more talk. It is full of pictures
of people of the day; Brougham and Wilson
Croker, and Southey, and George Canning,
and Mrs. Coutts and Lady Melbourne (Caroline
Lamb), all figure in it. He never gave over, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
putting portraits in his books&mdash;as Goldwin
Smith can tell us. The larger Reviews were coy
of praise and coy of condemnation: indeed ’twas
hard to say which way it pointed&mdash;socially or politically;
but, for the scandal-mongers, there was
in it very appetizing meat. He became a lion of
the salons; and he enjoyed the lionhood vastly.
Chalon<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> painted him in that day&mdash;a very Adonis&mdash;gorgeous
in velvet coat and in ruffled shirt.</p>

<p>But he grew tired of England and made his trip
of travel; it followed by nearly a score of years
after that of Childe Harold, and was doubtless
largely stimulated by it; three years he was gone&mdash;wandering
over all the East, as well as Europe.
He came back with an epic (published 1834), believing
that it was to fill men’s minds, and to conquer
a place for him among the great poets of the
century. In this he was dismally mistaken; so
he broke his lyre, and that was virtually the last
of his poesy. There came, however, out of these
journeyings, besides the poem, the stories of <cite>Contarini<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Fleming</cite>, of <cite>The Young Duke</cite>, and <cite>The
Wondrous Tale of Alroy</cite>. These kept his fame
alive, but seemed after all only the work of a man
playing with literature, rather than of one in
earnest.</p>

<p>With ambition well sharpened now, by what he
counted neglect, he turned to politics; as the son
of a country gentleman of easy fortune, it was not
difficult to make place for himself. Yet, with all
the traditions of a country gentleman about him,
in his first moves he was not inclined to Toryism;
indeed, he startled friends by his radicalism&mdash;was
inclined to shake hands at the outset
with the arch-agitator O’Connell; but not identifying
himself closely with either party; and so, to
the last it happened that his sympathies were
halved in most extraordinary way; he had the
concurrence of the most staid, Toryish, and conservative
of country voters; and no man could, like
himself, bring all the jingoes of England howling
at his back. Indeed, nothing is more remarkable
in his career than his shrewd adaptation of policy
to meet existing, or approaching tides of feeling;
he does not avow great convictions of duty, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
stand by them; but he toys with convictions;
studies the weakness, as he does the power, of
those with him or against him; shifts his ground
accordingly; rarely lacking poise, and the attitude
of seeming steadfastness; whipping with his
scourge of a tongue the little lapses of his adversaries
till they shrill all over the kingdom; and
putting his own triumphs&mdash;great or small&mdash;into
such scenic combination, with such beat of drum,
and blare of trumpet, as to make all England
break out into bravos.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> There was not that literary
quality in his books, either early or late,
which will give to them, I think, a very long life;
but there was in the man a quality of shrewdness
and of power which will be long remembered&mdash;perhaps
not always to his honor.</p>

<p>I do not yield to any in admiration for the noble
and philanthropic qualities which belong to the
venerable, retired statesman of Hawarden; yet I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
cannot help thinking that if such a firm and audacious
executive hand as belonged to Lord Beaconsfield,
had&mdash;in the season of General Gordon’s
stress at Khartoum&mdash;controlled the fleets and
armies of Great Britain, there would have been
quite other outcome to the sad imbroglio in the
Soudan. When war is afoot, the apostles of peace
are the poorest of directors.</p>

<p>I go back for a moment to that Blessington
Salon&mdash;in order to close her story. There was
a narrowed income&mdash;a failure of her jointure&mdash;a
shortening of her book sales; but, notwithstanding,
there was a long struggle to keep
that brilliant little court alive. One grows to
like so much the music and the fêtes and the
glitter of the chandeliers, and the unction of
flattering voices! But at last the ruin came; on
a sudden the sheriffs were there; and clerks with
their inventories in place of the “Tokens” and
“annuals”&mdash;with their gorgeous engravings by
Finden &amp; Heath&mdash;which the Mistress had exploited;
and she hurried off&mdash;after the elegant
D’Orsay&mdash;to Paris, hoping to rehabilitate herself,
on the Champs Elysées, under the wing of Louis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Napoleon, just elected President. I chanced to see
her in her coupé there, on a bright afternoon early
in 1849&mdash;with elegant silken wraps about her
and a shimmer of the old kindly smile upon her
shrunken face&mdash;dashing out to the Bois; but
within three months there was another sharp
change; she&mdash;dead, and her pretty <i lang="fr">decolleté</i> court
at an end forever.</p>

<h3>The Poet of Newstead.</h3>

<p>The reminiscences and conversations of Lord
Byron, which we have at the hands of Lady
Blessington, belong to a time, of course, much
earlier than her series of London triumphs, and
date with her journeys in Italy. A score of years
at least before ever the chandeliers of her Irish
ladyship were lighted in Gore House, Byron<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
gone sailing away from England under a storm
of wrath; and he never came back again. Indeed
it is not a little extraordinary that one of the most
typical of English poets, should&mdash;like Landor,
with whom he had many traits in common&mdash;have
passed so little of his active life on English
ground. Like Landor, he loved England most
when England was most behind him. Like
Landor, he was gifted with such rare powers as
belonged to few Englishmen of that generation.
In Landor these powers, so far as they expressed
themselves in literary form, were kept in check
by the iron rulings of a scrupulous and exacting
craftsmanship; while in Byron they broke all
trammels, whether of craftsmanship or reason, and
glowed and blazed the more by reason of their
audacities. Both were prone to great tempests of
wrath which gave to both furious joys, and, I
think, as furious regrets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>Byron came by his wrathfulness in good hereditary
fashion&mdash;as we shall find if we look back
only a little way into the records of that Newstead
family. Newstead Abbey (more properly Priory,
the archæologists tell us) is the name of that great
English home&mdash;half a ruin&mdash;associated with the
early years of the poet, but never for much time or
in any true sense a home of his own. It is some
ten miles north of Nottingham, in an interesting
country, where lay the old Sherwood Forest, with
its traditions of Robin Hood; there is a lichened
Gothic front which explains the Abbey name;
there are great rambling corridors and halls; there
is a velvety lawn, with the monument to “Boatswain,”
the poet’s dog; but one who goes there&mdash;with
however much of Byronic reading in his or
her mind&mdash;will not, I think, warm toward the
locality; and the curious foot-traveller will incline
to trudge away in a hunt for Annesley, and the
“Antique Oratory.”</p>

<p>Well, in that ancient home, toward the end of
the last century, there lived, very much by himself,
an old Lord Byron, who some thirty years
before, in a fit of wild rage, had killed a neighbor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and kinsman of the name of Chaworth; there was
indeed a little show of a duel about the murder&mdash;which
was done in a London tavern, and by
candle-light. His peerage, however, only saved
this “wicked lord,” as he was called, from prison;
and at Newstead his life smouldered out in 1798,
under clouds of hate, and of distrust. His son
was dead before him; so was his grandson, the
last heir in direct line; but he had a younger
brother, John, who was a great seaman&mdash;who published
accounts of his voyages,<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> which seem always
to have been stormy, and which lend, maybe, some
realistic touches to the shipwreck scenes in “Don
Juan.” A son of this voyager was the father of
the poet, and was reputed to be as full of wrath
and turbulence as his uncle who killed the
Chaworth; and his life was as thick with disaster
as that of the unlucky voyager. His first marriage
was a runaway one with a titled lady, whose heart
he broke, and who died leaving that lone daughter
who became the most worthy Lady Augusta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Leigh. For second wife he married Miss Gordon,
a Scotch heiress, the mother of the poet, whose
fortune he squandered, and whose heart also he
would have broken&mdash;if it had been of a breaking
quality. With such foregoers of his own name,
one might look for bad blood in the boy; nor was
his mother saint-like; she had her storms of
wrath; and from the beginning, I think, gave
her boy only cruel milk to drink.</p>

<p>His extreme boyhood was passed near to Aberdeen,
with the Highlands not far off. How much
those scenes impressed him, we do not know; but
that some trace was left may be found in verses
written near his death:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“He who first met the Highland’s swelling blue</div>
<div class="verse">Will love each peak that shows a kindred hue;</div>
<div class="verse">Hail in each crag a friend’s familiar face</div>
<div class="verse">And clasp the mountain in his mind’s embrace.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the boy was ten, the wicked lord who
had killed the Chaworth died; and the Newstead
inheritance fell to the young poet. We can
imagine with what touch of the pride that shivers
through so many of his poems, this lad&mdash;just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
lame enough to make him curse that unlucky
fate&mdash;paced first down the hall at Newstead&mdash;thenceforth
master there&mdash;a Peer of England.</p>

<p>But the estate was left in sorry condition; the
mother could not hold it as a residence; so they
went to Nottingham&mdash;whereabout the boy seems to
have had his first schooling. Not long afterward
we find him at Harrow, not far out of London,
where he makes one or two of the few friendships
which abide; there, too, he gives first evidence of
his power over language.</p>

<p>It is at about this epoch, also, that on his visits
to Nottingham&mdash;which is not far from the Chaworth
home of Annesley&mdash;comes about the spinning
of those little webs of romance which are
twisted afterward into the beautiful Chaworth
“Dream.” It is an old story to tell, yet how
everlastingly fresh it keeps!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The maid was on the eve of womanhood;</div>
<div class="verse">The boy had fewer summers, but his heart</div>
<div class="verse">Had far outgrown his years, and to his eye</div>
<div class="verse">There was but one beloved face on earth,</div>
<div class="verse">And that was shining on him; he had looked</div>
<div class="verse">Upon it till it could not pass away;</div>
<div class="verse">He had no breath, nor being, but in hers,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
<div class="verse">She was his voice … upon a tone,</div>
<div class="verse">A touch of hers, his blood would ebb and flow,</div>
<div class="verse">And his cheek change tempestuously&mdash;his heart</div>
<div class="verse">Unknowing of its cause of agony.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As a matter of fact, Miss Chaworth was two
years older, and far more mature than he; she was
gentle too, and possessed of a lady-like calm,
which tortured him&mdash;since he could not break it
down. Indeed, through all the time when he was
sighing, she was looking over his head at Mr.
Musters&mdash;who was bluff and hearty, and who
rode to the hounds, and was an excellent type of
the rollicking, self-satisfied, and beef-eating English
squire&mdash;whom she married.</p>

<h3>Early Verse and Marriage.</h3>

<p>After this episode came Cambridge, and those
<cite>Hours of Idleness</cite> which broke out into verse,
and caught the scathing lash of Henry Brougham&mdash;then
a young, but well-known, advocate, who
was conspiring with Sydney Smith and Jeffrey
(as I have told you) to renovate the world through
the pages of the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>.</p>

<p>But this lashing brought a stinging reply; and
the clever, shrewd, witty couplets of Byron’s satire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
upon the Scottish Reviewers (1809), convinced all
scholarly readers that a new and very piquant
pen had come to the making of English verse.
Nor were Byron’s sentimentalisms of that day all so
crude and ill-shapen as Brougham would have led
the public to suppose. I quote a fragment from
a little poem under date of 1808&mdash;he just twenty:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The dew of the morning</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Sunk chill on my brow</div>
<div class="verse">It felt like the warning</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Of what I feel now,</div>
<div class="verse">Thy vows are all broken</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And light is thy fame;</div>
<div class="verse">I hear thy name spoken,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And share in its shame.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“They name thee before me,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">A knell to mine ear;</div>
<div class="verse">A shudder comes o’er me&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Why wert thou so dear?</div>
<div class="verse">They know not I knew thee,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Who knew thee too well;</div>
<div class="verse">Long, long shall I rue thee</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Too deeply to tell.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Naturally enough, our poet is beaming with the
success of his satire, which is widely read, and
which has made him foes of the first rank; but
what cares he for this? He goes down with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
company of fellow roisterers, and makes the old
walls of Newstead ring with the noisy celebration
of his twenty-first birthday; and on the trail of that
country revel, and with the sharp, ringing couplets
of his “English Bards” crackling on the public
ear, he breaks away for his first joyous experience
of Continental travel. This takes him
through Spain and to the Hellespont and among
the isles of Greece&mdash;seeing visions there and
dreaming dreams, all which are braided into that
tissue of golden verse we know as the first two
cantos of <cite>Childe Harold</cite>.</p>

<p>On his return, and while as yet this poem of
travel is on the eve of publication, he prepares
himself for a new <i lang="fr">coup</i> in Parliament&mdash;being
not without his oratorical ambitions. It was
in February of 1812 that he made his maiden
speech in the House of Lords&mdash;carefully worded,
calm, not without quiet elegancies of diction&mdash;but
not meeting such reception as his
extravagant expectation demanded; whatever he
does, he wishes met with a tempest of approval; a
dignified welcome, to his fiery nature, seems cold.</p>

<p>But the publication of <cite>Childe Harold</cite>, only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
short time later, brings compensating torrents of
praise. His satire had piqued attention without
altogether satisfying it; there was little academic
merit in it&mdash;none of the art which made <cite>Absalom
and Achitophel</cite> glow, or which gleamed
upon the sword-thrusts of the <cite>Dunciad</cite>; but its
stabs were business-like; its couplets terse, slashing,
and full of truculent, scorching <i lang="la">vires iræ</i>.
This other verse, however, of <cite>Childe Harold</cite>&mdash;which
took one upon the dance of waves and under
the swoop of towering canvass to the groves of
“Cintra’s glorious Eden,” and among those Spanish
vales where Dark Guadiana “rolls his power
along;” and thence on, by proud Seville, and
fair Cadiz, to those shores of the Egean, where</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">was of quite another order. There is in it, moreover,
the haunting personality of the proud, broken-spirited
wanderer, who tells the tale and wraps
himself in the veil of mysterious and piquant sorrows:
Withal there is such dash and spirit, such
mastery of language, such marvellous descriptive
power, such subtle pauses and breaks, carrying
echoes beyond the letter&mdash;as laid hold on
men and women&mdash;specially on women&mdash;in a way
that was new and strange. And this bright meteor
had flashed athwart a sky where such stars as
Southey, and Scott, and Rogers, and the almost
forgotten Crabbe, and Coleridge, and Wordsworth
had been beaming for many a day. Was it
strange that the doors of London should be flung
wide open to this fresh, brilliant singer who had
blazed such a path through Spain and Greece, and
who wore a coronet upon his forehead?</p>

<p>He was young, too, and handsome as the morning;
and must be mated&mdash;as all the old dowagers
declared. So said his friends&mdash;his sister chiefest
among them; and the good Lady Melbourne
(mother-in-law of Lady Caroline Lamb)&mdash;not
without discreet family reasons of her own&mdash;fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
upon her charming niece, Miss Milbanke, as the
one with whom the new poet should be coupled,
to make his way through the wildernesses before
him. And there were other approvals; even Tom
Moore&mdash;who, of all men, knew his habits best&mdash;saying
a reluctant “Yes”&mdash;after much hesitation.
And so, through a process of coy propositions and
counter-propositions, the marriage was arranged
at last, and came about down at Seaham House
(near Stockton-on-Tees), the country home of the
father, Sir Ralph Milbanke.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">Our last chapter brought us into the presence
of that vivacious specimen of royalty,
George IV., who “shuffled off this mortal coil” in
the year 1830, and was succeeded by that rough-edged,
seafaring brother of his, William IV.
This admiral-king was not brilliant; but we found
brilliancy&mdash;of a sort&mdash;in the acute and disputatious
essayist, William Hazlitt; yet he was far
less companionable than acute, and contrasted
most unfavorably with that serene and most
worthy gentleman, Hallam, the historian. We
next encountered the accomplished and showy
Lady Blessington&mdash;the type of many a one who
throve in those days, and who had caught somewhat
of the glitter that radiated from the royal
trappings of George the Fourth. We saw Bulwer,
among others, in her salon; and we lingered longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
over the wonderful career of that Disraeli, who
died as Lord Beaconsfield&mdash;the most widely
known man in Great Britain.</p>

<p>We then passed to a consideration of that other
wonderful adventurer&mdash;yet the inheritor of an
English peerage&mdash;who had made his futile beginning
in politics, and a larger beginning in poetry.
To his career, which was left half-finished, we now
recur.</p>

<h3>Lord Byron a Husband.</h3>

<p>As we left him&mdash;you will remember&mdash;there
was a jangle of marriage-bells; and a wearisome
jangle it proved. Indeed Byron’s marriage-bells
were so preposterously out of tune, and lent their
discord in such disturbing manner to the whole
current of his life, that it may be worth our while
to examine briefly the conditions under which the
discord began. It is certain that all the gossips of
London had been making prey of this match of
the poetic hero of the hour for much time before
its consummation.</p>

<p>Was he seeking a fortune? Not the least in
the world; for though the burden of debt upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
his estates was pressing him sorely, and his extravagances
were reckless, yet large sums accruing
from his swift-written tales of the “Corsair,”
“Lara,” and “Bride of Abydos” were left untouched,
or lavishly bestowed upon old or new
friends; his liberality in those days was most exceptional;
nor does it appear that he had any
very definite notion of the pecuniary aid which
his bride might bring to him. She had, indeed, in
her own right, what was a small sum measured
by their standards of living; and her expectancies,
that might have justified the title of heiress
(which he sometimes gives to her in his journal),
were then quite remote.</p>

<p>As for social position, there could be by such
marriage no gain to him, for whom already the
doors of England were flung wide open. Did he
seek the reposeful dignity of a home? There may
have been such fancies drifting by starts through
his mind; but what crude fancies they must have
been with a man who had scarcely lived at peace
with his own mother, and whose only notion of
enjoyment in the house of his ancestors was in the
transport to Newstead of a roistering company of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
boon companions&mdash;followed by such boisterous
revels there, and such unearthly din and ghostly
frolics, as astounded the neighborhood!</p>

<p>The truth is, he marched into that noose of
matrimony as he would have ordered a new
suit from his tailor. When this whim had first
seized him, he had written off formal proposals to
Miss Milbanke&mdash;whom he knew at that time only
slightly; and she, with very proper prudence, was
non-committal in her reply&mdash;though suggesting
friendly correspondence. In his journal of a little
later date we have this entry:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“November 30, 1813 [some fourteen months before the
marriage]. Yesterday a very pretty letter from Annabella
[the full name was Anna Isabella], which I answered. What
an odd situation and friendship is ours! Without one spark
of love on either side. She is a very superior woman, and
very little spoiled … a girl of twenty, an only child
and a <i lang="fr">savante</i>, who has always had her own way.”</p>

</div>

<p>This evidently does not promise a very ardent
correspondence. Nay, it is quite possible that the
quiet reserve he encounters here, does offer a refreshing
contrast to the heated gush of which he
is the subject in that Babel of London; maybe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
too, there is something in the reserve and the assured
dignity which reminds him of that earlier
idol of his worship&mdash;Miss Chaworth of Annesley.</p>

<p>However, three months after this last allusion
to Miss Milbanke, we have another entry in his
journal, running thus:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“January 16, 1814. A wife would be my salvation. I am
getting rather into an admiration for C&mdash;&mdash;, youngest
sister of F&mdash;&mdash;. [This is not Miss Milbanke&mdash;observe.]
That she won’t love me is very probable, nor shall I love
her. The business would probably be arranged between the
papa and me.”</p>

</div>

<p>Perhaps it was in allusion to this new caprice
that he writes to Moore, a few months later:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Had Lady &mdash;&mdash; appeared to wish it, or even not to oppose
it, I would have gone on, and very possibly married,
with the same indifference which has frozen over the Black
Sea of almost all my passions.… Obstacles the
slightest even, stop me.” (<cite>Moore’s Byron</cite>, p. 255.)</p>

</div>

<p>And it is in face of some such obstacle, lifting
suddenly, that he flashes up, and over, into new
proposals to Miss Milbanke; these are quietly accepted&mdash;very
likely to his wonderment; for he
says, in a quick ensuing letter to Moore:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I certainly did not dream that she was attached to me,
which it seems she has been for some time. I also thought
her of a very cold disposition, in which I was also mistaken;
it is a long story, and I won’t trouble you with it. As to
her virtues, and so on, you will hear enough of them (for she
is a kind of <em>pattern</em> in the north) without my running into a
display on the subject.”</p>

</div>

<p>A little over two months after the date of this
they were married, and he writes to Murray in
the same week:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The marriage took place on the 2d inst., so pray make
haste and congratulate away.” [And to Moore, a few days
later.] “I was married this day week. The parson has pronounced
it; Perry has announced it, and the <cite>Morning Post</cite>,
also, under head of ‘Lord Byron’s marriage’&mdash;as if it were
a fabrication and the puff direct of a new stay-maker.”</p>

</div>

<p>A month and a half later, in another Moore letter,
alluding to the death of the Duke of Dorset
(an old friend of his), he says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There was a time in my life when this event would have
broken my heart; and all I can say for it now is&mdash;that it
isn’t worth breaking.”</p>

</div>

<p>Two more citations, and I shall have done with
this extraordinary record. In March, 1815 (the
marriage having occurred in January), he writes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
to Moore from the house of his father-in-law, Sir
Ralph Milbanke&mdash;a little northward of the Tees,
in County Durham:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am in such a state of sameness and stagnation, and so
totally occupied in consuming the fruits, and sauntering, and
playing dull games at cards, and yawning, and trying to read
old <cite>Annual Registers</cite> and the daily papers, and gathering
shells on the shore, and watching the growth of stunted gooseberries
in the garden, that I have neither time nor sense to
say more than yours ever&mdash;B.”</p>

</div>

<h3>A Stay in London.</h3>

<p>On leaving the country for a new residence in
London, his growing cheer and spirits are very
manifest:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have been very comfortable here. Bell is in health, and
unvaried good humor. But we are all in the agonies of
packing.… I suppose by this hour to-morrow I shall
be stuck in the chariot with my chin upon a band-box. I
have prepared, however, another carriage for the abigail, and
all the trumpery which our wives drag along with them.”</p>

</div>

<p>Well, there follows a year or more of this
coupled life&mdash;with what clashings we can imagine.
Old Ralph Milbanke is not there to drawl through
his after-dinner stories, and to intrude his restraining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
presence. The poet finds things to
watch about the clubs and the theatres&mdash;quite
other than the stunted gooseberries that grew in
his father-in-law’s garden. Nothing is more sure
than that the wilful audacities, and selfishness, and
temper of the poet, put my lady’s repose and
dignities and perfection to an awful strain. Nor
is it to be wondered at, if the mad and wild indiscretions
of the husband should have provoked
some quiet and galling counter indiscretions on
the part of her ladyship.</p>

<p>It is alleged, for instance, that on an early occasion&mdash;and
at the suggestion of a lady companion
of the august mistress&mdash;there was an inspection
of my lord’s private papers, and a sending home to
their writers of certain highly perfumed notelets
found therein; and we can readily believe that
when this instance of wifely zeal came to his lordship’s
knowledge he broke into a strain of
remark which was <em>not</em> precisely that of the
“Hebrew Melodies.” Doubtless he carries away
from such encounter a great reserve of bottled
wrath&mdash;not so much against her ladyship personally,
as against the stolid proprieties, the unbending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
scruples, the lady-like austerities, and the
cool, elegant dowager-dignities she represents.
Fancy a man who has put such soul as he has,
and such strength and hope and pride as he has,
into those swift poems, which have taken his
heart’s blood to their making&mdash;fancy him, asked
by the woman who has set out to widen his hopes
and life by all the helps of wifehood, “<cite>When&mdash;pray&mdash;he
means to give up those versifying habits
of his?</cite>” No, I do not believe he resented this in
language. I don’t believe he argued the point; I
don’t believe he made defence of versifying habits;
but I imagine that he regarded her with a dazed
look, and an eye that saw more than it seemed to
see&mdash;an eye that discerned broad shallows in her,
where he had hoped for pellucid depths. I think
he felt then&mdash;if never before&mdash;a premonition
that their roads would not lie long together. And
yet it gave him a shock&mdash;not altogether a pleasant
one, we may be sure&mdash;when Sir Ralph, the
father-in-law, to whose house she had gone on a
visit, wrote him politely to the effect that&mdash;“she
would never come back.” Such things cannot be
pleasant; at least, I should judge not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>And so, she thinks something more of marriage
than as some highly reckoned conventionality&mdash;under
whose cover bickerings may go on and
spend their force, and the decent twin masks be
always worn. And in him, we can imagine lingering
traces of a love for the feminine features in
her&mdash;for the grace, the dignity, the sweet face,
the modesties&mdash;but all closed over and buckled
up, and stanched by the everlasting and all encompassing
buckram that laces her in, and that has so
little of the compensating instinctive softness and
yieldingness which might hold him in leash and
win him back. The woman who cannot&mdash;on
occasions&mdash;put a weakness into her forgiveness,
can never put a vital strength into her persuasion.</p>

<p>But they part, and part forever; the only wonder
is they had not parted before; and still
another wonder is, that there should have been
zealous hunt for outside causes when so many are
staringly apparent within the walls of home. I
do not believe that Byron would have lived at
peace with one woman in a thousand; I do not
believe that Lady Byron would have lived at peace
with one man in a hundred. The computation is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
largely in her favor; although it does not imply
necessity for his condemnation as an utter brute.
Even as he sails away from England&mdash;from which
he is hunted with hue and cry, and to whose
shores he is never again to return&mdash;he drops a
farewell to her with such touches of feeling in it,
that one wonders&mdash;and future readers always will
wonder&mdash;with what emotions the mother and his
child may have read it:</p>

<p>I should have felt warranted in giving some intelligible
account of the poet’s infelicities at home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
were it only to lead up to this exhibit of his
wondrous literary skill; but I find still stronger
reasons in the fact that the hue and cry which
followed upon his separation from his wife seemed
to exalt the man to an insolent bravado, and a
challenge of all restraint&mdash;under which his genius
flamed up with new power, and with a blighting
splendor.</p>

<h3>Exile.</h3>

<p>It was on the 25th of April, 1816 (he being then
in his twenty-eighth year), that he bade England
adieu forever, and among the tenderest of his
leave-takings was that from his sister, who had
vainly sought to make smooth the difficulties in
his home, and who (until Lady Byron had fallen
into the blindness of dotage) retained her utmost
respect. I cannot forbear quoting two verses from
a poem addressed to this devoted sister:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Though the rock of my last hope is shivered</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And its fragments are sunk in the wave,</div>
<div class="verse">Though I feel that my soul is delivered</div>
<div class="verse indent1">To pain&mdash;it shall <em>not</em> be its slave;</div>
<div class="verse">There is many a pang to pursue me;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">They may crush&mdash;but they shall not contemn,</div>
<div class="verse">They may torture, but shall not subdue me,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">’Tis of <em>thee</em> that I think&mdash;not of them.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“From the wreck of the past, which hath perished,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Thus much I at least may recall,</div>
<div class="verse">It hath taught me that what I most cherished</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Deserved to be dearest of all;</div>
<div class="verse">In the desert a fountain is springing,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">In the wide waste, there still is a tree,</div>
<div class="verse">And a bird in the solitude singing</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Which speaks to my spirit of <em>thee</em>.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Never was a man pelted away from his native
shores with more anathemas; never one in whose
favor so few appealing voices were heard. It was
not so much a memory of his satirical thrusts, as
a jealousy begotten by his late extraordinary successes,
which had alienated nearly the whole literary
fraternity. Only Rogers, Moore, and Scott were
among the better known ones who had forgiven
his petulant verse, and were openly apologetic and
friendly; while such kind wishers as Lady Holland
and Lady Jersey were half afraid to make a show
of their sympathies. Creditors, too, of that burdened
estate of his, had pushed their executions one
upon another&mdash;in those days when his torments
were most galling&mdash;into what was yet called with
poor significance his home; only his title of peer,
Moore tells us, at one date saved him from prison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet when he lands in Belgium, he travels&mdash;true
to his old recklessness&mdash;like a prince; with
body servants and physician, and a lumbering
family coach, with its showy trappings. Waterloo
was fresh then, and the wreck and the blood,
and the glory of it were all scored upon his brain,
and shortly afterward by his fiery hand upon
the poem we know so well, and which will carry
that streaming war pennon in the face of other
generations than ours. Then came the Rhine,
with its castles and traditions, glittering afresh in
the fresh stories that he wove; and after these his
settlement for a while upon the borders of Lake
Geneva&mdash;where, in some one of these talks of ours
we found the studious Gibbon, under his acacia-trees,
and where Rousseau left his footprints&mdash;never
to be effaced&mdash;at Clarens and Meillerie.
One would suppose that literature could do no
more with such outlooks on lake and mountain, as
seem to mock at language.</p>

<p>And yet the wonderful touch of Byron has
kindled new interest in scenes on which the glowing
periods of Rousseau had been lavished. Even
the guide-books can none of them complete their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
record of the region without stealing descriptive
gems from his verse; and his story of the
<cite>Prisoner of Chillon</cite> will always&mdash;for you and
for me&mdash;lurk in the shadows that lie under those
white castle walls, and in the murmur of the
waters that ebb and flow&mdash;gently as the poem&mdash;all
round about their foundations. I may mention
that at the date of the Swiss visit, and under
the influences and active co-operation of Madame
de Staël&mdash;then a middle-aged and invalid lady residing
at her country seat of Coppet, on the borders
of Geneva Lake&mdash;Byron did make overtures
for a reconciliation with his wife. They proved
utterly without avail, even if they were not treated
with scorn. And it is worthy of special note that
while up to this date all mention of Lady Byron
by the poet had been respectful, if not relenting
and conciliatory&mdash;thereafter the vials of his wrath
were opened, and his despairing scorn knew no
bounds. Thus, in the “Incantation”&mdash;thrust
into that uncanny work of <cite>Manfred</cite>&mdash;with which
he was then at labor&mdash;he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Though thou seest me not pass by,</div>
<div class="verse">Thou shalt feel me with thine eye,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
<div class="verse">As a thing that, though unseen,</div>
<div class="verse">Must be near thee, and hath been;</div>
<div class="verse">And when, in that secret dread,</div>
<div class="verse">Thou hast turned around thy head,</div>
<div class="verse">Thou shalt marvel I am not</div>
<div class="verse">As thy shadow on the spot;</div>
<div class="verse">And the power which thou dost feel</div>
<div class="verse">Shall be what thou must conceal.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<h3>Shelley and Godwin.</h3>

<p>Another episode of Byron’s Swiss life was his
encounter there, for the first time, with the poet
Shelley.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> He, too, was under ban, for reasons
that I must briefly make known. Like his
brother poet, Shelley was born to a prospective
inheritance of title and of wealth. His father
was a baronet, shrewd and calculating, and living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
by the harshest and baldest of old conventionalisms;
this father had given a warm, brooding care
to the estate left him by Sir Bysshe Shelley (the
grandfather of the poet), who had an American
bringing up&mdash;if not an American birth&mdash;in the
town of Newark,<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> N. J. The boy poet had the advantages
of a place at Eton<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>&mdash;not altogether a
favorite there, it would seem; “passionate in his
resistance to an injury, passionate in his love.”
He carried thence to Oxford a figure and a
beauty of countenance that were almost effeminate;
and yet he had a capacity for doubts and
negations that was wondrously masculine. His
scholarship was keen, but not tractable; he takes
a wide range outside the established order of
studies; he is a great and unstinted admirer of
the French philosophers, and makes such audacious
free-thinking challenge to the church dignitaries
of Oxford that he is expelled&mdash;like something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
venomous. His father, too, gives him the
cold shoulder at this crisis, and he drifts to London.
There he contrives interviews with his
sisters, who are in school at Clapham; and is decoyed
into a marriage&mdash;before he is twenty&mdash;with
a somewhat pretty and over-bold daughter
of a coffee-house keeper, who has acted as a go-between
in communications with his sisters. The
prudent, conventional father is now down upon
him with a vengeance.</p>

<p>But the boy has pluck under that handsome
face of his. He sets out, with his wife&mdash;after
sundry wanderings&mdash;to redeem Ireland; but they
who are used to blunderbusses, undervalue
Shelley’s fine periods, and his fine face. He is
some time in Wales, too (the mountains there
fastening on his thought and cropping out in after
poems); he is in Edinboro’, in York, in Keswick&mdash;making
his obeisance to the great Southey
(but coming to over-hate of him in after years).
Meantime he has children. Sometimes money
comes from the yielding father&mdash;sometimes none;
he is abstemious; bread and water mostly his
diet; his home is without order or thrift or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
invitingness&mdash;the lapses of the hoydenish girl-wife
stinging him over and over and through and
through.</p>

<p>But Shelley has read Godwin’s <cite>Political Justice</cite>&mdash;one
of those many fine schemes for the world’s
renovation, by tearing out and burning up most
of the old furniture, which make their appearance
periodically&mdash;and in virtue of his admiration of
Godwin, Shelley counts him among the demi-gods
of the heaven which he has conjured up. In
reality Godwin<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> was an oldish, rather clumsy, but
astute and clever dissenting minister, who had left
preaching, and had not only written <cite>Political Justice</cite>,
but novels&mdash;among them one called <cite>Caleb
Williams</cite>; by which you will know him better&mdash;if
you know him at all. This gave him great
reputation in its time. There were critics who
ranked him with, or above, Scott&mdash;even in fiction.
This may tempt you to read <cite>Caleb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Williams</cite>;<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and if you read it&mdash;you will not forget it.
It pinches the memory like a vice; much reading
of it might, I should think, engender, in one
of vivid imagination, such nightmare stories as
“<cite>Called Back</cite>” or “<cite>A Dark Day</cite>.”</p>

<p>But Mr. Godwin had a daughter, Mary (whose
mother was that Mary Wollstonecraft, promoted
now to a place amongst famous women), and our
Shelley going to see Godwin, saw also the daughter
Mary&mdash;many times over; and these two&mdash;having
misty and mystic visions of a new order of
ethics&mdash;ran away together.</p>

<p>It must be said, however, to the credit of Shelley
(if credit be the word to use), that when this
first wife killed herself&mdash;as she did some eighteen
months afterward<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> (whether from grief or other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
cause is doubtful)&mdash;he married Miss Godwin; and
it was during the summer preceding this second
marriage that Byron (1816) encountered Shelley
on the shores of Lake Leman. Shelley had already
written that wild screed of <cite>Queen Mab</cite>
(privately printed, 1813), giving poetic emphasis
to the scepticism of his Oxford days. He had
published that dreamy poem of <cite>Alastor</cite>&mdash;himself
its poet hero, as indeed he was in a large sense of
every considerable poem he wrote. I cite a fragment
of it, that you may see what waking and
beguiling voice belonged to the young bard, who
posed there on the Geneva lake beside the more
masculine Byron. He has taken us into forest
depths:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent6">“One vast mass</div>
<div class="verse">Of mingling shade, whose brown magnificence</div>
<div class="verse">A narrow vale embosoms.</div>
<div class="verse indent6">The pyramids</div>
<div class="verse">Of the tall cedar, overarching, frame</div>
<div class="verse">Most solemn domes within; and far below,</div>
<div class="verse">Like clouds suspended in an emerald sky,</div>
<div class="verse">The ash and the acacia floating, hang</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Tremulous and pale. Like restless serpents clothed</div>
<div class="verse">In rainbow and in fire, the parasites</div>
<div class="verse">Starred with ten thousand blossoms flowed around</div>
<div class="verse">The gray trunks; and as gamesome infants’ eyes,</div>
<div class="verse">With gentle meanings and most innocent wiles</div>
<div class="verse">Fold their beams round the hearts of those that love,</div>
<div class="verse">These twine their tendrils with the wedded boughs.</div>
<div class="verse indent6">… the woven leaves</div>
<div class="verse">Make net-work of the dark blue lights of day</div>
<div class="verse">And the night’s noontide clearness, mutable</div>
<div class="verse">As shapes in the weird clouds.</div>
<div class="verse indent6">One darkest glen</div>
<div class="verse">Sends from its woods of musk-rose twined with jasmine</div>
<div class="verse">A soul-dissolving odor, to invite</div>
<div class="verse">To some more lovely mystery. Through the dell</div>
<div class="verse">Silence and twilight here, twin sisters, keep</div>
<div class="verse">Their noonday watch, and sail among the shades</div>
<div class="verse">Like vaporous shapes half seen.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And such mysteries and vaporous shapes run
through all his poetic world. He wanders, with
that rarely fine gift of rhythmic speech, as wide
away from the compact sordid world&mdash;upon
which Byron always sets foot with a ringing tread&mdash;as
ever Spenser in his chase of rainbow creations.
Yet there were penetrative sinuous influences
about that young poet&mdash;defiant of law and
wrapt in his pursuit of mysteries&mdash;which may
well have given foreign touches of color to Byron’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
<cite>Manfred</cite> or to his <cite>Prometheus</cite>. At any rate,
these two souls lay quietly for a time, warped
together&mdash;like two vessels windbound under
mountain shelter.</p>

<h3>Byron in Italy.</h3>

<p>Byron next goes southward, to riotous life in
Venice; where&mdash;whether in tradesmen’s houses
or in palaces upon the Grand Canal, or in country
villas upon the Euganean hills&mdash;he defies priests
and traditions, and order, and law, and decency.</p>

<p>To this period belongs, probably, the conception,
if not the execution, of many of those dramas<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>&mdash;as
non-playable as ever those of Tennyson&mdash;unequal,
too, but with passages scattered here and there of
great beauty; masterly aggregation of words
smoking with passion, and full of such bullet-like
force of expression as only he could command;
but there is no adequate blending of parts to make
either stately or well-harmonized march of events
toward large and definite issues.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Out of the Venetian welter came, too, the
fourth canto of <cite>Childe Harold</cite> and the opening
parts of <cite>Don Juan</cite>. The mocking, rollicking,
marvellous <cite>Vision of Judgment</cite>, whose daring
license staggered even Murray and Moore, and
which scarified poor Southey, belongs to a later
phase of his Italian career. It is angry and
bitter&mdash;and has an impish laughter in it&mdash;of a
sort which our friend Robert Ingersoll might
write, if his genius ran to poetry. <cite>Cain</cite> had
been of a bolder tone&mdash;perhaps loftier; with
much of the argument that Milton puts into
the mouth of Satan, amplified and rounded,
and the whole illuminated by passages of wonderful
poetic beauty.</p>

<p>His scepticism, if not so out-spoken and full of
plump negatives as that of Shelley, is far more
mocking and bitter. If Shelley was rich in negations&mdash;so
far as relates to orthodox belief&mdash;he
was also rich in dim, shadowy conceptions of a
mysterious eternal region, with faith and love
reigning in it&mdash;toward which in his highest range
of poetic effusion he makes approaches with an
awed and a tremulous step. But with Byron&mdash;even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
where his words carry full theistic beliefs&mdash;the
awe and the tremulous approaches are wanting.</p>

<h3>Shelley Again.</h3>

<p>Shelley went back from Switzerland to a home
for a year or more, beyond Windsor, near to
Bisham&mdash;amid some of the loveliest country that
borders upon the Thames. Here he wrote that
strange poem of <cite>Laon and Cythna</cite> (or <cite>Revolt of
Islam</cite>, as it was called on its re-issue), which, so
far as one can gather meaning from its redundant
and cumulated billows of rich, poetic language,
tells how a nation was kindled to freedom by
the strenuous outcry of some young poet-prophet&mdash;how
he seems to win, and his enemies become
like smoking flax&mdash;how the dreadful fates that
beset us, and crowd all worldly courses from their
best outcome, did at last trample him down; not
him only, but the one dearest to him&mdash;who is a
willing victim&mdash;and bears him off into the shades
of night. Throughout, Laon the Victim is the
poet’s very self; and the very self appears again&mdash;with
what seems to the cautious, world-wise reader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
a curious indiscretion&mdash;in the pretty jumping
metre of “Rosalind and Helen”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Joyous he was; and hope and peace</div>
<div class="verse">On all who heard him did abide,</div>
<div class="verse">Raining like dew from his sweet talk,</div>
<div class="verse">As where the evening star may walk</div>
<div class="verse">Along the brink of the gloomy seas,</div>
<div class="verse">Liquid mists of splendid quiver.</div>
<div class="verse">His very gestures touched to tears</div>
<div class="verse">The unpersuaded tyrant, never</div>
<div class="verse">So moved before.…</div>
<div class="verse">Men wondered, and some sneered, to see</div>
<div class="verse">One sow what he could never reap;</div>
<div class="verse">For he is rich, they said, and young,</div>
<div class="verse">And might drink from the depths of luxury.</div>
<div class="verse">If he seeks Fame, Fame never crowned</div>
<div class="verse">The champion of a trampled creed;</div>
<div class="verse">If he seeks Power, Power is enthroned</div>
<div class="verse">’Mid ancient rights and wrongs, to feed</div>
<div class="verse">Which hungry wolves with praise and spoil,</div>
<div class="verse">Those who would sit near Power must toil.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was in 1818, four years before his death, that
Shelley sailed away from English shores forever.
There was not much to hold him there; those
children of the Westbrook mother he cannot know
or guide.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> The Chancellor of England has decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
that question against him; and Law, which he
has defied, has wrought him this great pain; nay,
he has wild, imaginary fears, too, that some Lord
Chancellor, weaving toils in that web of orderly
British custom, may put bonds on these other and
younger children of the Godwin blood. Nor is it
strange that a world of more reasonable motives
should urge this subtle poet&mdash;whose head is carried
of purpose, and by love, among the clouds&mdash;to
turn his back on that grimy, matter-of-fact
England, and set his face toward those southern
regions where Art makes daily food, and where he
may trail his robes without the chafings of law or
custom. But do not let me convey the impression
that Shelley then or ever lived day by day wantonly
lawless, or doing violence to old-fashioned
proprieties; drunkenness was always a stranger to
him, to that new household&mdash;into which he had
been grafted by Godwinian ethics&mdash;he is normally
true; he would, if it were possible, bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
into the lap of his charities those other estrays
from whom the law divides him; his generosities
are of the noblest and fullest; he even entertains
at one time the singular caprice of “taking
orders,” as if the author of <cite>Queen Mab</cite> could hold
a vicarage! It opens, he said, so many ways of
doing kindly things, of making hearts joyful; and&mdash;for
doctrine, one can always preach Charity!
With rare exceptions, it is only in his mental attitudes
and forays that he oversteps the metes and
bounds of the every-day moralities around him.
Few poets, even of that time, can or do so measure
him as to enjoy him or to give him joy. Leigh
Hunt is gracious and kindly; but there are no
winged sandals on his feet which can carry him
into regions where Shelley walks. Southey is
stark unbeliever in the mystic fields where Shelley
grazes. Wordsworth is conquered by the Art, but
has melancholy doubts of the soul that seems
caught and hindered in the meshes of its own
craftsmanship. Landor, of a certainty, has detected
with his keen insight the high faculties
that run rampant under the mazes of the new
poet’s language; but Landor, too, is in exile&mdash;driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
hither and thither by the same lack of
steady home affinities which has overset and embroiled
the domesticities of the younger poet.</p>

<h3>John Keats.</h3>

<p>Yet another singer of these days, in most earnest
sympathy with the singing moods of Shelley&mdash;for
whom I can have only a word now, was
John Keats;<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> born within the limits of London
smoke, and less than three-quarters of a mile from
London Bridge&mdash;knowing in his boy days only
the humblest, work-a-day ranges of life; getting
some good Latinity and other schooling out of a
Mr. Clarke (of the Cowden Clarke family)&mdash;reading
Virgil with him, but no Greek. And yet
the lad, who never read Homer save in Chapman,
when he comes to write, as he does in extreme
youth, crowds his wonderful lines with the delicate
trills and warblings which might have broken out
straight from Helicon&mdash;with a susurrus from the
Bees of Hymettus. This makes a good argument&mdash;so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
far as it reaches&mdash;in disproof of the averments
of those who believe that, for conquest of
Attic felicities of expression, the Greek vocables
must needs be torn forth root by root, and
stretched to dry upon our skulls.</p>

<p>He published <cite>Endymion</cite> in the very year when
Shelley set off on his final voyagings&mdash;a gushing,
wavy, wandering poem, intermeshed with flowers
and greenery (which he lavishes), and with fairy
golden things in it and careering butterflies; with
some bony under-structure of Greek fable&mdash;loose
and vague&mdash;and serving only as the caulking pins
to hold together the rich, sensuous sway, and the
temper and roll of his language.</p>

<p>I must snatch one little bit from that book of
<cite>Endymion</cite>, were it only to show you what music
was breaking out in unexpected quarters from that
fact-ridden England, within sound of the murmurs

<p>Well, this young master of song goes to Italy,
too&mdash;not driven, like Byron, by hue and cry, or
like Shelley, restless for change (from Chancellor’s

the disease which has firm grip upon him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
which some three years after Shelley’s going
kills the poet of the <cite>Endymion</cite> at Rome. His
ashes lie in the Protestant burial-ground there&mdash;under
the shadow of the pyramid of Caius Cestius.
Every literary traveller goes to see the grave, and
to spell out the words he wanted inscribed there:</p>

<p>The weak place in this impassioned commemorative
poem lies in its waste of fire upon the heads
of those British critics, who&mdash;as flimsy, pathetic

savagery. Keats did not range among giants; but
he was far too strong a man to die of the gibes of
the <cite>Quarterly</cite>, or the jeers of <cite>Blackwood</cite>. Not
this; but all along, throughout his weary life&mdash;even

<h3>Buried in Rome.</h3>

<p>Keats died in 1821. In that year Shelley was
living between Lirici, on the gulf of Spezia, and
Pisa. While in this latter city, he was planted for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
a time at the old Lanfranchi palace, where in the
following season very much at the instance and
urgence of Shelley, Leigh Hunt came with his six
riotous young children, and sometimes made a din&mdash;that
was new to Byron and most worrisome&mdash;in
the court of the Lanfranchi house. Out of this
Hunt fraternizing and co-working (forecast by the
kindly Shelley) was to be built up the success of
that famous “Liberal” Journal, dear to the hearts
of Shelley and Hunt, of which I have already
spoken, and which had disastrous failure; out of
this aggregation of disorderly poetic elements grew
also the squabbles that gave such harsh color to
the <cite>Reminiscences</cite> of Leigh Hunt.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>But other and graver disaster was impending.
Shelley loved the sea, and carried with him to the
water the same reckless daring which he put into
his verse. Upon a summer day of July, 1822, he
went with a friend and one boatman for a sail
upon the bay of Spezia, not heeding some cautions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
that had been dropped by old seamen, who
had seen portents of a storm; and his boat sailed
away into the covert of the clouds. Next day
there were no tidings, nor the next, nor the next.
Finally wreck and bodies came to the shore.</p>

<p>Trelawney, Byron’s friend, tells a grim story of
it all&mdash;how the dismal truth was carried to the
widowed wife, how the body of the drowned poet
was burned upon the shore, with heathen libations
of oil and wine; how Byron and Hunt both were
present at the weird funeral&mdash;the blue Mediterranean
lapping peacefully upon the beach and the
black smoke lifting in great clouds from the pyre
and throwing lurid shadows over the silent company.
The burial&mdash;such as there was of it&mdash;took
place in that same Protestant graveyard at Rome&mdash;just
out of the Porta San Paolo&mdash;where we
were just now witnesses at the burial of Keats.</p>

<p>Shelley made many friendships, and lasting
ones. He was wonderfully generous; he visited
the sick; he helped the needy; putting himself
often into grievous straits for means to give
quickly. As he was fine of figure and of feature,
so his voice was fine, delicate, penetrative, yet in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
moments of great excitement rising to a shrillness
that spoiled melody and rasped the ear; so his
finer generosities and kindnesses sometimes passed
into a rasping indifference or even cruelty toward
those nearest him, he feeling that first Westbrook
<i lang="fr">mesalliance</i>, on occasions, like a torture&mdash;specially
when the presence of the tyrannic,
coarse, aggravating sister-in-law was like a poisonous
irritant; he&mdash;under the teachings of a
conscientious father, in his young days&mdash;was
scarce more than half responsible for his wry
life; running to badnesses&mdash;on occasions&mdash;under
good impulses; perhaps marrying that first wife
because she wanted to marry him; and quitting
her&mdash;well&mdash;because “she didn’t care.” Intellectually,
as well as morally, he was pagan; seeing
things in their simplest aspects, and so dealing
with them; intense, passionate, borne away in
tempests of quick decision, whose grounds he
cannot fathom; always beating his wings against
the cagements that hem us in; eager to look into
those depths where light is blinding and will not
let us look; seeming at times to measure by some
sudden reach of soul what is immeasurable; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
under the vain uplifts, always reverent, with a dim
hope shining fitfully; contemptuous of harassing
creeds or any jugglery of forms&mdash;of whatever
splendid fashionings of mere material, whether
robes or rites&mdash;and yearning to solve by some
strong, swift flight of imagination what is insoluble.
There are many reverent steps that go to
that little Protestant cemetery&mdash;an English
greenery upon the borders of the Roman Campagna&mdash;where
the ashes of Shelley rest and
where myrtles grow. And from its neighborhood,
between Mount Aventine and the Janiculan
heights, one may see reaches of the gleaming
Tiber, and the great dome of St. Peter’s lifting
against the northern sky, like another tomb, its
cross almost hidden in the gray distance.</p>

<h3>Pisa and Don Juan.</h3>

<p>No such friendship as that whose gleams have
shot athwart these latter pages could have been
kindled by Byron. No “Adonais” could have
been writ for him; he could have melted into no
“Adonais” for another; old pirate blood, seething
in him, forbade. No wonder he chafed at Hunt’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
squalling children in the Lanfranchi palace; <em>that</em>
literary partnership finds quick dissolution. He
sees on rare occasions an old English friend&mdash;he,
who has so few! Yet he is in no mood to make
new friends. The lambent flames of the Guiccioli
romance hover and play about him, making
the only counterfeit of a real home which he has
ever known. The proud, independent, audacious,
lawless living that has been his so long, whether
the early charms lie in it or no&mdash;he still clings
by. His pen has its old force, and the words spin
from it in fiery lines; but to pluck the flowers
worth the seeking, which he plants in them now,
one must go over quaking bogs, and through ways
of foulness.</p>

<p>The <cite>Childe Harold</cite> has been brought to its conclusion
long before; its cantos, here and there
splendidly ablaze with Nature&mdash;its storms, its
shadows, its serenities; and the sentiment&mdash;now
morbid, now jubilant&mdash;is always his own, though
it beguiles with honeyed sounds, or stabs like a
knife.</p>

<p>There have been a multitude of lesser poems,
and of dramas which have had their inception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
and their finish on that wild Continental holiday&mdash;beginning
on <cite>Lac Leman</cite> and ending at Pisa
and Genoa; but his real selfhood&mdash;whether of
mind or passion&mdash;seems to me to come out plainer
and sharper in the <cite>Don Juan</cite> than elsewhere.
There may not be lifts in it, which rise to the romantic
levels of the “Pilgrimage;” there may
be lack of those interpolated bits of passion, of
gloom, of melancholy, which break into the
earlier poem. But there is the blaze and crackle
of his own mad march of flame; the soot, the cinders,
the heat, the wide-spread ashes, and unrest
of those fires which burned in him from the beginning
were there, and devastated all the virginal
purities of his youth (if indeed there were any!)
and welded his satanic and his poetic qualities into
that seamy, shining, wonderful residue of dirty
scoriæ, and of brilliant phosphorescence, which we
call <cite>Don Juan</cite>. From a mere literary point of
view there are trails of doggerel in it, which the
poet was too indolent to mend, and too proud to
exclude. Nor can it ever be done; a revised
Byron would be not only a Byron emasculated,
but decapitated and devastated. ’Twould lack the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
links that tie it to the humanities which coil and
writhe tortuously all up and down his pages. His
faults of prosody, or of ethics, or of facts&mdash;his
welter, at intervals, through a barren splendor of
words&mdash;are all typical of that fierce, proud, ungovernable,
unconventional nature. This leopard
will and should carry all his spots. We cannot
shrive the man; no chanters or churches can do
this; he disdains to be shriven at human hands,
or, it would seem, any other hands. The impact
of that strong, vigorous nature&mdash;through his
poems&mdash;brings, to the average reader, a sense of
force, of brilliancy, of personality, of humanity (if
gone astray), which exhilarates, which dashes away
a thousand wordy memories of wordy verses, and
puts in their place palpitating phrases that throb
with life. An infinite capability for eloquent
verse; an infinite capability for badnesses! We
cannot root out the satanry from the man, or his
books, any more than we can root out Lucifer
from Milton’s Eden. But we can lament both,
and, if need be, fight them.</p>

<p>Whether closer British influence (which usually
smote upon him, like sleet on glass)&mdash;even of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
that “Ancient Oratory” of Annesley&mdash;would have
served to whiten his tracks, who shall say?
Long ago he had gone out from them, and from
parish church and sermon; his hymns were the
<cite>Ranz des Vaches</cite> on the heights of the <cite>Dent de
Jaman</cite>, and the preachments he heard were the
mellowed tones of convent bells&mdash;filtering through
forest boughs&mdash;maybe upon the ear of some
hapless Allegra, scathed by birth-marks of a sin
that is not her own&mdash;conning her beads, and
listening and praying!</p>

<h3>Missolonghi.</h3>

<p>It was in 1823, when he was living in Genoa&mdash;whither
he had gone from Pisa (and before this,
Ravenna)&mdash;that his sympathies were awakened in
behalf of the Greeks, who since 1820 had been in
revolt against their Turkish taskmasters. He had
been already enrolled with those Carbonari&mdash;the
forerunners of the Mazzinis and the Garibaldis&mdash;who
had labored in vain for the independence and
unity of Italy; and in many a burst of his impassioned
song he had showered welcoming praises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
upon a Greece that should be free, and with equal
passion attuned his verse to the lament&mdash;that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Freedom found no champion and no child</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Such as Columbia saw arise when she</div>
<div class="verse">Sprung forth a Pallas, armed and undefiled.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>How much all this was real and how much
only the romanticism of the poet, was now to be
proven. And it was certainly with a business-like
air that he cut short his little <i lang="fr">agaceries</i> with the
Lady Blessington, and pleasant dalliance with the
Guiccioli, for a rallying of all his forces&mdash;moneyed
or other&mdash;in the service of that cause for which
the brave Marco Bozzaris had fallen, fighting,
only three months before. It was in July that he
embarked at Genoa for Greece&mdash;in a brig which
he had chartered, and which took guns and ammunition
and $40,000 of his own procurement,
with a retinue of attendants&mdash;including his trusty
Fletcher&mdash;besides his friends Trelawney and the
Count Gamba. They skirted the west coast of
Italy, catching sight of Elba&mdash;then famous for
its Napoleonic associations&mdash;and of Stromboli,
whose lurid blaze, reflected upon the sea, startled
the admiring poet to a hinted promise&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
those fires should upon some near day reek on the
pages of a Fifth Canto of <cite>Childe Harold</cite>.</p>

<p>Mediterranean ships were slow sailers in those
days, and it was not until August that they arrived
and disembarked at Cephalonia&mdash;an island
near to the outlet of the Gulf of Corinth, and lying
due east from the Straits of Messina. There was a
boisterous welcome to the generous and eloquent
peer of England; but it was a welcome that
showed factional discords. Only across a mile or
two of water lay the Isle of Ithaca, full of vague,
Homeric traditions, which under other conditions
he would have been delighted to follow up; but
the torturing perplexities about the distribution
of moneys or ammunition, the jealousies of quarrelsome
chieftains, the ugly watch over drafts
and bills of exchange, and the griping exactions
of local money-changers, made all Homeric fancies
or memories drift away with the scuds of wind
that blew athwart the Ionian seas.</p>

<p>He battled bravely with the cumulating difficulties&mdash;sometimes
maddened to regret&mdash;other
times lifted to enthusiasm by the cordial greeting
of such a chieftain as Mavrocordatos, or the street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
cheers of a band of Suliotes. So months passed,
until he embarked again, in equipage of his own,
with his own fittings, for Missolonghi, where
final measures were to be taken. Meantime he is
paying for his ships, paying for his Suliotes,
paying for delays, and beset by rival chieftains for
his interest, or his stimulating presence, or his
more stimulating moneys. On this new but short
sea venture he barely escapes capture by a Turkish
frigate&mdash;is badly piloted among the rocky
islets which stud the shores; suffers grievous
exposure&mdash;coming at last, wearied and weakened,
to a new harborage, where welcomes are vociferous,
but still wofully discordant. He labors
wearily to smooth the troubled waters, his old,
splendid allegiance to a free and united Greece
suffering grievous quakes, and doubts; and when
after months of alternating turbulence and rest
there seems promise of positive action, he is
smitten by the fever of those low coasts&mdash;aggravated
by his always wanton exposures. The attack
is as sudden as a shot from a gun&mdash;under
which he staggers and falls, writhing with pain,
and I know not what convulsional agonies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>There is undertaken an Italian regimen of cupping
and leeching about the brow and temples,
from which the bleeding is obstinate, and again
and again renewed. But he rallies; attendants are
assiduous in their care. Within a day or two he
has recovered much of the old <i lang="la">vires vitæ</i>, when on
a sudden there is an alarm; a band of mutinous
Suliotes, arms in hand, break into his lordship’s
apartments, madly urging some trumpery claim
for back-pay. Whereupon Byron&mdash;showing the
old savagery of his ancestors&mdash;leaps from his bed,
seizes whatever weapon is at hand, and gory&mdash;with
his bandaged head still trickling blood&mdash;he
confronts the mutineers; his strength for the
moment is all his own again, and they are cowered
into submission, their yataghans clinking as they
drop to the tiled flooring of his room.</p>

<p>’Twas a scene for Benjamin West to have
painted in the spirit of Death on the Pale Horse,
or for some later artist&mdash;loving bloody “impressions.”
However, peace is established. Quiet
reigns once more (we count by days only, now).
There is a goodly scheme for attack upon the
fortress which guards the Gulf of Lepanto (Corinth);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the time is set; the guards are ready;
the Suliotes are under bidding; the chieftains are
(for once) agreed, when, on the 18th, he falters,
sinks, murmurs some last words&mdash;“Ada&mdash;daughter&mdash;love&mdash;Augusta&mdash;” barely
caught;
doubtfully caught; but it is all&mdash;and the poet
of <cite>Childe Harold</cite> is gone, and that turbulent,
brilliant career hushed in night.</p>

<p>It was on April 19, 1824, that he died. His
body was taken home for burial. I said <em>home</em>;
’twere better to have said to England, to the
family vault, in which his mother had been laid;
and at a later day, his daughter, Ada, was buried
there beside him, in the old Hucknall-Torkard
church. The building is heavy and bald, without
the winning picturesqueness that belongs to so
many old country churches of Yorkshire. The beatitudes
that are intoned under its timbered arch
are not born of any rural beatitudes in the surroundings.
The town is small, straggly, bricky,<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
and neither church nor hamlet nor neighbors’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
houses are suffused with those softened tints which
verdure, and nice keeping, and mellow sunshine
give to so many villages of southern England.
Hucknall-Torkard is half way between Nottingham
and Newstead, and lies upon that northern
road which pushes past Annesley into the region
of woods and parks where Sherwood forest once
flung its shadows along the aisles in which the
bugle notes of master Robin Hood woke the echoes.</p>

<p>But Hucknall-Torkard church is bald and tame.
Mr. Winter, in his pleasant descriptive sketch,<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
does indeed give a certain glow to the “grim”
tower, and many a delightful touch to the gray
surroundings; but even he would inhibit the
pressure of the noisy market-folk against the
church-yard walls, and their rollicking guffaw.
And yet, somehow, the memory of Byron does
not seem to me to mate well with either home or
church quietudes, and their serenities. Is it not
proper and fitting after all that the clangor of a
rebellious and fitful world should voice itself near
such a grave? Old mossy and ivied towers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
which church bells are a-chime, and near trees
where rooks are cawing with home-sounds, do not
marry happily with our memories of Byron.</p>

<p>Best of all if he had been given burial where
his heart lies, in that Ætolian country, upon some
shaggy fore-land from which could have been seen&mdash;one
way, Ithaca and the Ionian seas, and to
the southward, across the Straits of Lepanto, the
woody depths of the Morea, far as Arcadia.</p>

<p>But there is no mending the matter now; he
lies beside his harsh Gordon mother in the middle
of the flat country of stockings, lace curtains, and
collieries.</p>

<p>Another poet, William Lisle Bowles, in a quaint
sonnet has versed this Gordon mother’s imaginary
welcome to her dead son:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent6">“Could that mother speak,</div>
<div class="verse">In thrilling, but with hollow accent weak,</div>
<div class="verse">She thus might give the welcome of the dead:</div>
<div class="verse">‘Here rest, my son, with me; the dream is fled;</div>
<div class="verse">The motley mask, and the great stir is o’er.</div>
<div class="verse">Welcome to me, and to this silent bed,</div>
<div class="verse">Where deep forgetfulness succeeds the roar</div>
<div class="verse">Of life, and fretting passions waste the heart no more!’”</div>

with her own wrathful spirit&mdash;to the days when
he uttered the “Idle” songs&mdash;coined in the courts
of Cambridge&mdash;and to those quick succeeding
days, when his mad verse maddened English bards
and Scotch reviewers. Then came the passages of
love&mdash;with Mary Chaworth, which was real and
vain; with a Milbanke, which was a mockery and
ended in worse than mockery; all these experiences
whetting the edge of that sword of song
with which he carved a road of romance for thousands
of after journeymen to travel, through
the old Iberian Peninsula, and the vales of Thessaly.
Then there was the turning away, in rage,
from the shores of England, the episode with the
Shelley household on the borders of Lake Leman,
with its record of “crag-splitting” storms and
sunny siestas; and such enduring memorials as
the ghastly <cite>Frankenstein</cite> of Mrs. Shelley, the
Third Canto of <cite>Childe Harold</cite>, and the child-name
of&mdash;Allegra.</p>

<p>Next came Venice, where the waves lapped
murmurously upon the door-steps of the palaces
which “Mi-lord” made noisy with his audacious
revelry. To this succeeded the long stay at Ravenna,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
with its pacifying and lingering, reposeful
reach of an attachment, which was beautiful in
its sincerity, but as lawless as his life. After
Ravenna came Pisa with its Hunt-Lanfranchi
coruscations of spleen, and its weird interlude of
the burning of the body of his poor friend Shelley
upon the Mediterranean shores. Song, and drama,
and tender verselets, and bagnio-tainted pictures
of Don Juan, gleamed with fervid intensity
through the interstices of this Italian life; but
they all came to a sudden stay when he sailed for
Greece, and with a generosity as strong as his
wilder passions, flung away his fortune and his
life in that vortex of Suliote strifes and deadly
miasmas, which was centred amid the swamplands
of Missolonghi.</p>

<p>The Cretans of to-day (1897), and the men of
Thessaly, and of the Morea, and Albanians all,
may find a lift of their ambitions and a spur to
their courage in Byron’s sacrifice to their old struggle
for liberty, and in his magnificent outburst
of patriotic song. So, too, those who love real
poetry will never cease to admire his subtle turns
of thought, and his superb command of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
resources of language. But the households are
few in which his name will be revered as an apostle
of those cheering altitudes of thought which
encourage high endeavor, or of those tenderer
humanities which spur to kindly deeds, and give
their glow to the atmosphere of homes.</p>

<h3>King William’s Time.</h3>

<p>The last figure that we dealt with among England’s
kings was that bluff, vulgar-toned sailor,
William IV., whom even the street-folk criticise,
because he spat from his carriage window when
driving on some State ceremonial.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Nor was this
the worst of his coarsenesses; he swore&mdash;with
great ease and pungency. He forgot his dignity;
he insulted his ministers; he gave to Queen Adelaide,
who survived him many years as dowager,
many most uncomfortable half-hours; and if he
read the new sea-stories of Captain Marryat&mdash;though
he read very little&mdash;I suspect he loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
more the spicier condiments of <cite>Peregrine Pickle</cite>
and of <cite>Tom Jones</cite>.</p>

<p>Yet during the period of his short reign&mdash;scarce
seven years&mdash;events happened&mdash;some
through his slow helpfulness, and none suffering
grievously from his obstructiveness&mdash;which gave
new and brighter color to the political development
and to the literary growth of England. There
was, for instance, the passage of the Reform Bill
of 1832 (of which I have already spoken, in connection
with Sydney Smith)&mdash;not indeed accomplishing
all its friends had hoped; not inaugurating
a political millennium; not doing away with
the harsh frictions of state-craft; no reforms ever
do or can; but broadening the outlook and range
of all publicists, and stirring quiet thinkers into
aggressive and kindling and hopeful speech. Very
shortly after this followed the establishment of
that old society for the “Diffusion of Useful
Knowledge” which came soon to the out-put&mdash;under
the editorship of Charles Knight&mdash;of the
<cite>Penny Cyclopædia</cite> and the <cite>Penny Magazine</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>I recall distinctly the delight with which&mdash;as
boys&mdash;we lingered over the pictured pages of that
magazine&mdash;the great forerunner of all of our illustrated
monthlies.</p>

<p>To the same period belong those <cite>Tracts for the
Times</cite>, in which John Keble, the honored author
of the <cite>Christian Year</cite>, came to new notice, while
his associates, Dr. Pusey and Cardinal Newman,
gave utterance to speech which is not without reverberating
echoes, even now. Nor was it long
after this date that British journalism received a
great lift, and a great broadening of its forces, by
a reduction of the stamp-tax&mdash;largely due to the
efforts of Bulwer Lytton&mdash;whereby British newspapers
increased their circulation, within two
years, by 20,000,000 annually.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>All these things had come about in the reign of
William IV.; but to none of them had he given
any enthusiastic approval, or any such urgence of
attention as would have dislocated a single one of
his royal dinners.</p>

<p>In 1837 he died&mdash;not very largely sighed over;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
least of all by that sister-in-law, the Duchess of
Kent, whom he had hated for her starched proprieties,
whom he had insulted again and again,
and who now, in her palace of Kensington, prepared
her daughter Victoria for her entrance upon
the sovereignty.</p>

<h3>Her Majesty Victoria.</h3>

<p>The girl was only eighteen&mdash;well taught, discreet,
and modest. Greville tells us that she was
consumed with blushes when her uncles of Sussex
and of Cumberland came, with the royal council,
to kneel before her, and to kiss her hand in token
of the new allegiance.</p>

<p>The old king had died at two o’clock of the
morning; and by eleven o’clock on the same day
the duties of royalty had begun for the young
queen, in receiving the great officers of state.
Among the others she meets on that first regal day
in Kensington Palace, are Lansdowne, the fidgety
Lord Brougham, the courtly Sir Robert Peel, and
the spare, trim-looking old Duke of Wellington,
who is charmed by her gracious manner, and by
her self-control and dignity. He said he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
not have been more proud of her if she had been
his own daughter.</p>

<p>Nearer to the young queen than all these&mdash;by
old ties of friendship, that always remained unshaken&mdash;was
the suave and accomplished Lord
Melbourne&mdash;First Minister&mdash;who has prepared
the queen’s little speech for her, which she reads
with charming self-possession; to him, too, she
looks for approval and instruction in all her progress
through the new ceremonials of Court, and
the ordering of a royal household. And Melbourne
is admirably suited to that task; he was
not a great statesman; was never an orator, but
possessed of all the arts of conciliation&mdash;adroit
and full of tact, yet kindly, sympathetic, and winning.
Not by any means a man beyond reproach
in his private life, but bringing to those new
offices of political guardianship to the young
queen only the soundest good-sense and the
wisest of advice&mdash;thus inspiring in her a trust
that was never forfeited.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was under Melbourne’s encouragements,
and his stimulative commendation (if stimulus
were needed), that the young princess formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
shortly after that marriage relation which proved
altogether a happy one&mdash;giving to England
and to the world shining proof that righteous
domesticities were not altogether clean gone from
royal houses. And if the good motherly rulings
have not had their best issues with some of the
male members of the family, can we not match
these wry tendencies with those fastening upon
the boys of well-ordered households all around us?
It is not in royal circles only that his satanic
majesty makes friends of nice boys, when the girls
escape him&mdash;or seem to!</p>

<p>Well, I have gone back to that old palace of
Kensington, which still, with its mossy brick walls,
in the west of London, baffles the years, and the
fogs&mdash;the same palace where we went to find William
III. dying, and the gracious Queen Anne too;
and where now the Marquis of Lorne and the Princess
Louise have their home. I have taken you
again there to see how the young Victoria bore
herself at the news of her accession&mdash;with the
great councillors of the kingdom about her&mdash;not
alone because those whom we shall bring to the
front, in this closing chapter, have wrought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
during her reign; but because, furthermore,
she with her household have been encouragers
and patrons of both letters and of art in many
most helpful ways; and yet, again, because this
queen, who has within this twelve-month (1897)
made her new speech to Parliament&mdash;sixty years
after that first little speech at Kensington&mdash;is
herself, in virtue of certain modest book-making,
to be enrolled with all courtesy in the Guild of
Letters. And though the high-stepping critics
may be inclined to question the literary judgment
or the scrupulous finish of her book-work, we cannot,
I think, deny to it a thoroughly humane tone,
and a tender realism. We greet her not only by
reason of her queenship proper, but for that larger
sovereignty of womanhood and of motherhood
which she has always dignified and adorned.</p>

<p>I once caught such glimpse of her&mdash;as strangers
may&mdash;in the flush of her early wedded life; not
beautiful surely, but comely, kindly, and radiant,
in the enjoyment of&mdash;what is so rare with sovereigns&mdash;a
happy home-life; and again I came
upon other sight of her eight years later, when
the prince was a rollicking boy, and the princess a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
blooming maiden; these and lesser rosy-cheeked
ones were taking the air on the terrace at Windsor,
almost in the shadow of the great keep, which has
frowned there since the days of Edward III.</p>

<h3>Macaulay.</h3>

<p>In the early days of Queen Victoria’s reign&mdash;when
Sir Robert Peel was winning his way to the
proud position he later held&mdash;when American and
English politicians were getting into the toils of
the “Maine Boundary” dispute (afterward settled
by Ashburton and Webster), and when the Countess
of Blessington was making “Gore House”
lively with her little suppers, and the banker
Rogers entertaining all <i lang="fr">beaux esprits</i> at his home
near the Green Park, there may have been found
as guest at one of the banker’s famous breakfasts&mdash;somewhere
we will say in the year 1838&mdash;a
man, well-preserved, still under forty&mdash;with a
shaggy brow, with clothes very likely ill-adjusted
and ill-fitting, and with gloves which are never
buttoned&mdash;who has just come back from India,
where he has held lucrative official position. He
is cogitating, it is said, a history of England, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
his talk has a fulness and richness that seem inexhaustible.</p>

<p>You know to whom I must refer&mdash;Thomas Babington
Macaulay<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>&mdash;not a new man at Rogers’s
table, not a new man to bookish people; for he
had won his honors in literature, especially by a
first paper on Milton, published in the year 1825
in the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>. This bore a new stamp
and had qualities that could not be overlooked.
There are scores of us who read that paper for the
first time in the impressionable days of youth, who
are carried back now by the mere mention of it to
the times of the old Puritan poet.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We can almost fancy that we are visiting him in his
small lodging; that we see him sitting at the old organ beneath
the faded green hangings; that we can catch the quick
twinkle of his eyes, rolling in vain to find the day; that we
are reading in the lines of his noble countenance the proud
and mournful history of his glory and his affliction!”</p>

</div>

<p>Macaulay came of good old Scotch stock&mdash;his
forefathers counting up patriarchal families in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
Coll and Inverary; but his father, Zachary
Macaulay, well known for his anti-slavery action
and influence, and for his association with Wilberforce,
married an English Quaker girl from Bristol&mdash;said
to have been a <i lang="fr">protégée</i> of our old
friend, Mistress Hannah More. Of this marriage
was born, in 1800, at the charming country house
of an aunt, named Babington, in the pleasant
county of Leicestershire, the future historian.</p>

<p>The father’s first London home was near by
Lombard Street, where he managed an African
agency under the firm name of Macaulay &amp; Babington;
and the baby Macaulay used to be wheeled
into an open square near by, for the enjoyment of
such winter’s sunshine as fell there at far-away
intervals. His boyish memories, however, belonged
to a later home at Clapham, then a suburban
village. There, was his first schooling, and
there he budded out&mdash;to the wonderment of all
his father’s guests&mdash;into young poems and the
drollest of precocious talk. His pleasant biographer
(Trevelyan) tells of a visit the bright boy
made at Strawberry Hill&mdash;Walpole’s old showplace.
There was a spilling of hot drink of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
sort, during the visitation, which came near to
scalding the lad; and when the sympathizing
hostess asked after his suffering: “Thank you,
madam,” said he, “the agony is abated!” The
story is delightfully credible; and so are other
pleasant ones of his reciting some of his doggerel
verses to Hannah More and getting a gracious and
approving nod of her gray curls and of her mob-cap.</p>

<p>At Cambridge, where he went at the usual student
age, he studied what he would, and discarded
what he would&mdash;as he did all through his life.
For mathematics he had a distinguished repugnance,
then and always; and if brought to task
by them in those student days&mdash;trying hard to
twist their certainties into probabilities, and so
make them subject to that world of “ifs and
buts” which he loved to start buzzing about the
ears of those who loved the exact sciences better
than he. He missed thus some of the University
honors, it is true; yet, up and down in those Cambridge
coteries he was a man looked for, and listened
to, eagerly and bravely applauded. Certain
scholastic honors, too, he did reap, in spite of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
lunges outside the traces; there was a medal for
his poem of <cite>Pompeii</cite>; and a Fellowship, at last,
which gave him a needed, though small income&mdash;his
father’s Afric business having proved a failure,
and no home moneys coming to him thereafter.</p>

<p>The first writings of Macaulay which had public
issue were printed in <cite>Knight’s Quarterly Magazine</cite>&mdash;among
them were criticisms on Italian
writers, a remarkable imaginary conversation between
“Cowley and Milton,” and the glittering,
jingling battle verses about the War of the
League and stout “Henry of Navarre”&mdash;full to
the brim of that rush and martial splendor which
he loved all his life, and which he brought in later
years to his famous re-heralding of the <cite>Lays of
Ancient Rome</cite>. A few lines are cited:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The King is come to marshal us, in all his armor drest;</div>
<div class="verse">And he has bound a snow-white plume upon his gallant crest.</div>
<div class="verse">He looked upon his people, and a tear was in his eye;</div>
<div class="verse">He looked upon the traitors, and his glance was stern and high.</div>
<div class="verse">Right graciously he smiled on us, as rolled from wing to wing</div>
<div class="verse">Down all our line a deafening shout, ‘God save our Lord the King!’</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
<div class="verse">And if my standard bearer fall, as fall full well he may,</div>
<div class="verse">For never saw I promise yet of such a bloody fray;</div>
<div class="verse">Press where ye see my white plume shine, amidst the ranks of war,</div>
<div class="verse">And be your oriflamme to-day the helmet of Navarre!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On the year after this “Battle of Ivry” had
sparkled into print appeared the paper on Milton,
to which I have alluded, and which straightway
set London doors open to the freshly
fledged student-at-law. Crabb Robinson, in his
diary of those days, speaks patronizingly of a
“young gentleman of six or seven and twenty,
who has emerged upon the dinner-giving public,”
and is astounding old habitués by his fulness and
brilliancy of talk. He had not, to be sure, those
lighter and sportive graces of conversation which
floated shortly thereafter out from the open windows
of Gore House, and had burgeoned under the
beaming smiles of Lady Blessington. But he
came to be a table match for Sydney Smith, and
was honored by the invitations of Lady Holland,<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
who allowed no new find of so brilliant feather to
escape her.</p>

<h3>In Politics and Verse.</h3>

<p>Macaulay’s alliance with the Scottish Reviewers,
and his known liberalism, make him a pet of
the great Whigs; and through Lansdowne, with a
helping hand from Melbourne, he found his way
into Parliament: there were those who prophesied
his failure in that field; I think Brougham in those
days, with not a little of jealousy in his make up,
was disposed to count him a mere essayist. But
his speeches in favor of the Reform bill belied all
such auguries. Sir Robert Peel declared them to
be wonderful in their grasp and eloquence; they
certainly had great weight in furthering reform;
and his parliamentary work won presently for him
the offer from Government of a place in India.
No Oriental glamour allured him, but the new position
was worth £10,000 per annum. He counted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
upon saving the half of this, and returning after
five years with a moderate fortune. He did better,
however&mdash;shortening his period of exile by nearly
a twelve-month, and bringing back £30,000.</p>

<p>His sister (who later became Lady Trevelyan)
went with him as the mistress of his Calcutta
household; and his affectionate and most tender
relations with this, as well as with his younger
sister, are beautifully set forth in the charming
biography by his nephew, Otto Trevelyan. It is a
biography that everybody should read; and none
can read it, I am sure, without coming to a kindlier
estimate of its subject. The home-letters with
which it abounds run over with affectionate playfulness.
We are brought to no ugly <i lang="la">post mortem</i>
in the book, and no opening of old sores. It is
modest, courteous, discreet, and full.</p>

<p>Macaulay did monumental work in India upon
the Penal Code. He also kept up there his voracious
habits of reading and study. Listen for a
moment to his story of this:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“During the last thirteen months I have read Eschylus,
twice; Sophocles, twice; Euripides, once; Pindar, twice;
Callimachus, Apollonius Rhodius, Theocritus, twice; Herodotus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Thucydides, almost all of Xenophon’s works, almost all of
Plato, Aristotle’s <cite>Politics</cite>, and a good deal of his <cite>Organon</cite>;
the whole of Plutarch’s Lives; half of Lucian; two or three
books of Athenæus; Plautus, twice; Terence, twice; Lucretius,
twice; Catullus, Propertius, Lucan, Statius, Silius Italicus,
Livy, Velleius Paterculus, Sallust, Cæsar, and lastly,
Cicero.”</p>

</div>

<p>This is his classical list. Of his modern reading
he does not tell; yet he was plotting the <cite>History
of England</cite>, and the bouncing balladry of the
<cite>Lays of Rome</cite> was even then taking shape in the
intervals of his study.</p>

<p>His father died while Macaulay was upon his
voyage home from India&mdash;a father wholly unlike
the son, in his rigidities and his Calvinistic asperities;
but always venerated by him, and in the
latter years of the old gentleman’s life treated
with a noble and beautiful generosity.</p>

<p>A short visit to Italy was made after the return
from India; and it was in Rome itself that he
put some of the last touches to the Lays&mdash;staying
the work until he could confirm by personal observation
the relative sites of the bridge across the
Tiber and the home of Horatius upon the Palatine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>You remember the words perhaps; if not, ’twere
well you should,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Alone stood brave Horatius,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">But constant still in mind;</div>
<div class="verse">Thrice thirty thousand foes before,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And the broad flood behind.</div>
<div class="verse">‘Down with him!’ cried false Sextus,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">With a smile on his pale face.</div>
<div class="verse">‘Now yield thee,’ cried Lars Porsena,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">‘Now yield thee to our grace!’</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Round turned he, as not deigning</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Those craven ranks to see;</div>
<div class="verse">Nought spake he to Lars Porsena,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">To Sextus nought spake he!</div>
<div class="verse">But he saw on Palatinus</div>
<div class="verse indent1">The white porch of his home;</div>
<div class="verse">And he spake to the noble river</div>
<div class="verse indent1">That rolls by the towers of Rome.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Oh, Tiber, father Tiber!</div>
<div class="verse indent1">To whom the Romans pray,</div>
<div class="verse">A Roman’s life, a Roman’s arms,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Take thou in charge this day!’</div>
<div class="verse">So he spake, and speaking sheathed</div>
<div class="verse indent1">The good sword by his side,</div>
<div class="verse">And, with his harness on his back,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Plunged headlong in the tide.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This does not sound like those verses of Shelley,
which we lately encountered. Those went through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
the empyrean of song like Aurora’s chariot of the
morning, with cherubs, and garlands, and flashing
torches. This, in the comparison, is like some
well-appointed dump-cart, with sleek, well-groomed
Percheron horses&mdash;up to their work,
and accomplishing what they are set to do absolutely
well.</p>

<p>It was not until 1842, a year or two after the
Italian visit, that Macaulay ventured to publish
that solitary book of his verse; he very
much doubted the wisdom of putting his literary
reputation in peril by such overture in
rhyme. It extorted, however, extravagant praise
from that muscular critic Christopher North;
while the fastidious Hunt writes to him (begging
a little money&mdash;as was his wont), and regretting
that the book did not show more of the poetic
aroma which breathes from the <cite>Faerie Queene</cite>.
But say what we may of its lack&mdash;there is no
weakly maundering; it is the work of a man full-grown,
with all his wits active, and his vision clear,
and who loved plain sirloins better than the fricandeaux
and ragoûts of the artists.</p>

<p>There is also a scholarly handling, with high,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
historic air blowing through&mdash;as if he liked
his Homer better than his Spenser; his prosody
is up to the rules; the longs and shorts are split
to a hair’s breadth&mdash;jingling and merry where
the sense calls for it; and sober and resonant
where meaning is weighty; flashing, too, where
need is&mdash;with sword play and spear-heads that
glitter and waver over marching men; but nowhere&mdash;I
think it must be said&mdash;the tremulous
poetic <em>susurrus</em>, that falters, and touches, and detains
by its mystic sounds&mdash;tempting one into
dim border-lands where higher and more inspired
singers find their way. Christabel is not of his
school, nor the star-shaped shadow of Wordsworth’s
Daisy.</p>

<h3>Parliamentarian and Historian.</h3>

<p>Meantime occasional papers from Macaulay’s
hand found their way into the pages of the great
Northern <cite>Review</cite>&mdash;but by no means so many as
the Whig managers could have wished; he had
himself grown to think lightly of such work; the
History was calling for his best powers, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
were parliamentary duties devolving upon him as
member for Edinboro’.</p>

<p>I remember catching sight of him somewhere
between 1844 and 1846&mdash;in his place in the House
of Commons, and of listening to his brilliant castigation
of Sir Robert Peel, in the matter, I think,
of the Maynooth grant. He was well toward fifty
then, but sturdy&mdash;with the firm tread of a man
who could do his three or four leagues of walking&mdash;if
need were; beetle-browed; his clothes ill-adjusted;
his neck bundled in a big swathing of
cravat. There was silence when he rose; there
was nothing orator-like in his bearing; rather
awkward in his pose; having scorn, too, as would
seem, for any of the graces of elocution. But he
was clear, emphatic, direct, with a great swift
river of words all bearing toward definite aim.
Tory critics used to say he wrote his speeches
and committed them to memory. There was no
need for that. Words tripped to his tongue as
easily as to his pen. But there were no delicate
modulations of voice; no art of pantomime; no
conscious or unconscious assumption of graceful
attitudes; and when subject-matter enfevered and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
kindled him&mdash;as it did on that occasion&mdash;there
was the hurry and the over-strained voice of extreme
earnestness.</p>

<p>It was not very long after this that he met with
a notable repulse from his old political supporters
in Edinboro’ that touched him grievously. But
there were certain arts of the politician he could
not, and would not learn; he could not truckle;
he could not hobnob with clients who made vulgar
claims upon him. He could not make domiciliary
visits, to kiss the babies&mdash;whether of patrons, or
of editors; he could not listen to twaddle from
visiting committees, without breaking into a righteous
wrath that hurt his chances. Edinboro’,
afterward, however, cleared the record, by giving
him before his death a triumphant return to
Parliament.</p>

<p>Meantime that wonderful History had been written,
and its roll of magniloquent periods made
echo in every quarter of the literary world. Its
success was phenomenal. After the issue of its
second couplet of volumes the publishers sent to
the author a check for £20,000 on account. Such
checks passing between publisher and author were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
then uncommon; and&mdash;without straining a point&mdash;I
think I may say they are now. With its Macaulay
endorsement, it makes a unique autograph,
now in the possession of the Messrs. Longmans&mdash;but
destined to find place eventually among the
manuscript treasures of the British Museum.</p>

<p>The great history is a partisan history, but it is
the work of a bold and out-spoken and manly partisan.
The colors that he uses are intense and
glaring; but they are blended in the making of
his great panorama of King William’s times, with
a marvellous art. We are told that he was an advocate
and not a philosopher; that he was a rhetorician
and not a poet. We may grant all this,
and we may grant more&mdash;and yet I think we
shall continue to cherish his work. Men of
greater critical acumen and nicer exploration may
sap the grounds of some of his judgments; cooler
writers, and those of more self-restraint, may draw
the fires by which his indignations are kindled;
but it will be very long before the world will
cease to find high intellectual refreshment in the
crackle of his epigrams, in his artful deployment
of testimony, in his picturesque array of great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
historic characters and in the roll of his sonorous
periods.</p>

<p>Yet he is the wrong man to copy; his exaltations
make an unsafe model. He exaggerates&mdash;but
he knows how to exaggerate. He paints a
truth in colors that flow all round the truth, and
enlarge it. Such outreach of rhetoric wants corresponding
capacity of brain, and pen-strokes that
never swerve or tremble. Smallish men should
beware how they copy methods which want fulness
of power and the besom of enthusiasm to fill
out their compass. Homer can make all his sea-waves
iridescent and multitudinous&mdash;all his
women high-bosomed or blue-eyed&mdash;and all his
mountains sweep the skies: but <em>we</em> should be
modest and simple.</p>

<p>It was not until Macaulay had done his last
work upon the book (still incomplete) which
he counted his monument, that he moved away
from his bachelor quarters in the Albany (Piccadilly)
and established himself at Holly Lodge,
which, under the new name (he gave it) of Oirlie
Lodge, may be found upon a winding lane in
that labyrinth of city roads that lies between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Kensington Gardens and Holland House. There
was a bit of green lawn attached, which he came
to love in those last days of his; though he
had been without strong rural proclivities. Like
Gibbon, he never hunted, never fished, rarely
rode. But now and then&mdash;among the thorn-trees
reddening into bloom and the rhododendrons
bursting their buds, the May mornings were
“delicious” to him. He enjoyed, too, overmuch,
the modest hospitalities he could show in a home
of his own. There are joyfully turned notes&mdash;in
his journal or in his familiar letters&mdash;of “a goose
for Michaelmas,” and of “a chine and oysters for
Christmas eve,” and “excellent audit ale” on Lord
Mayor’s day. There, too, at Holly Lodge, comes
to him in August, 1857, when he was very sad
about India (as all the world were), an offer of a
peerage. He accepts it, as he had accepted all the
good things of life&mdash;cheerily and squarely, and was
thenceforward Baron Macaulay of Rothley. He
appears from time to time on the benches of the
Upper House, but never spoke there. His speaking
days were over. A little unwonted fluttering of
the heart warned him that the end was not far off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>A visit to the English lakes and to Scotland
in 1859 did not&mdash;as was hoped&mdash;give him access
of strength. He was much disturbed, too (at this
crisis), by the prospect of a long separation from
his sister, Lady Trevelyan&mdash;whose husband had
just now been appointed Governor of Madras.
“This prolonged parting,” he says, “this slow
sipping of the vinegar and the gall is terrible!”
And the parting came earlier than he thought, and
easier; for on a day of December in the same year
he died in his library chair. His nephew and
biographer had left him in the morning&mdash;sitting
with his head bent forward on his chest&mdash;an attitude
not unusual for him&mdash;in a languid and
drowsy reverie. In the evening, a little before
seven, Lady Trevelyan was summoned, and the
biographer says:&mdash;“As we drove up to the porch
of my uncle’s house, the maids ran crying into the
darkness to meet us; and we knew that all was
over.”</p>

<p>He was not an old man&mdash;only fifty-nine. The
stone which marks his grave in Westminster Abbey
is very near to the statue of Addison.</p>

<p>In estimating our indebtedness to Macaulay as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
a historian&mdash;where his fame and execution were
largest&mdash;we must remember that his method of
close detail forbade wide outlook or grasp of long
periods of time. If he had extended the same
microscopic examination and dramatic exhibit of
important personages to those succeeding reigns,
which he originally intended to cover&mdash;coming
down to the days of William IV.&mdash;he would have
required fifty volumes; and if he had attempted,
in the same spirit, a reach like that of Green or
Hume, his rhetorical periods must have overflowed
more than two hundred bulky quartos! No ordinary
man could read such; and&mdash;thank Heaven!&mdash;no
extraordinary man could write so many.</p>

<h3>Some Tory Critics.</h3>

<p>Among those who sought with a delightsome
pertinacity for flaws in the historic work of
Macaulay, in his own time, was John Wilson
Croker, to whom I have already alluded.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> He
was an older man than the historian; Irish by
birth, handsome, well-allied by marriage, plausible,
fawning on the great (who were of <em>his</em> party) wearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
easily and boastfully his familiarity with Wellington,
Lansdowne and Cumberland, airing
daintily his literary qualities at the tables of Holland
or Peel; proud of his place in Parliament,
where he loved to show a satiric grace of speech,
and the curled lips of one used to more elegant
encounters. In short, he was the very man to
light up the blazing contempt of such another as
Macaulay; more than all since Croker was identified
with the worst form of Toryism, and the
other always his political antagonist.</p>

<p>Such being the <i lang="la">animus</i> of the parties, one can
imagine the delight of Croker in detecting a blunder
of Macaulay, and the delight of Macaulay
when he was able to pounce upon the blunders
in Croker’s edition of <cite>Boswell’s Johnson</cite>. This
was on many counts an excellent work and&mdash;with
its emendations&mdash;holds its ground now;
but I think the slaps, and the scourgings, and
the derisive mockery which the critic dealt out
to the self-poised and elegant Croker have made
a highly appetizing <i lang="fr">sauce piquante</i> for the book
these many a year. For my own part, I never
enjoy it half so much as when I think of Macaulay’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
rod of discipline “starting the dust out
of the varlet’s [editor’s] jacket.”</p>

<p>It is not a question if Croker deserved this excoriation;
we are so taken up with the dexterity
and effectiveness with which the critical professor
uses the surgeon’s knife, that we watch the
operation, and the exceeding grace and ease with
which he lays bare nerve after nerve, without once
inquiring if the patient is really in need of such
heroic treatment.</p>

<p>The Croker Papers<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>&mdash;two ponderous volumes
of letters and diary which have been published in
these latter years&mdash;have good bits in them; but
they are rare bits, to be dredged for out from
quagmires of rubbish. The papers are interesting,
furthermore, as showing how a cleverish man, with
considerable gifts of presence and of brain, with
his re-actionary Toryism dominant, and made a
fetich of, can still keep a good digestion and go in
a respectable fashion through a long life&mdash;backwards,
instead of “face to the front.”</p>

<p>In this connection it is difficult to keep out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
mind that other Toryish administrator of the
<cite>Quarterly</cite> bombardments of reform and of Liberalists&mdash;I
mean Lockhart (to whom reference has
already been made in the present volume), and
who, with all of Croker’s personal gifts, added to
these a still larger scorn than that of his elder associate
in the Quarterly conclaves, for those whose
social disabilities disqualified them for breathing
the rarefied air which circulated about Albemarle
Street and the courts of Mr. Murray. Even Mr.
Lang in his apologetic but very interesting story
of Lockhart’s life,<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> cannot forbear quiet reprehensive
allusions to that critic’s odious way of
making caustic allusion to “the social rank” of
political opponents; although much of this he avers
“is said in wrath.” Yet it is an unworthy wrath,
always and everywhere, which runs in those directions.
Lockhart, though an acute critic, and a
very clever translator, was a supreme worshipper
of “conditions,” rather than of qualities. He
never forgave Americans for being Americans, and
never preter-mitted his wrathy exposition of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
‘low-lived antecedents’ socially. The baronetcy
of his father-in-law, Sir Walter Scott, was I
think, a perpetual and beneficent regalement to
him.</p>

<h3>Two Gone-by Story Tellers.</h3>

<p>Must it be said that the jolly story-teller of the
sea and of the sea-ports, who wrote for our uncles
and aunts, and elder brothers, the brisk, rollicking
tales about <cite>Midshipman Easy</cite>, and <cite>Japhet in
Search of a Father</cite>, is indeed gone by?</p>

<p>His name was Frederick Marryat,<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> the son of a
well-to-do London gentleman, who had served the
little Borough of Sandwich as member of Parliament
(and was also author of some verses and
political tractates), but who did not wean his boy
from an inborn love of the sea. To gratify this
love the boy had sundry adventurous escapades;
but when arrived at the mature age of fourteen, he
entered as midshipman in the Royal Navy&mdash;his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
first service, and a very active one, being with that
brave and belligerent Lord Cochrane, who later
won renown on the west coast of South America.
Adventures of most hazardous and romantic qualities
were not wanting under such an officer, all of
which were stored in the retentive memory of the
enthusiastic and observant midshipman, and thereafter,
for years succeeding, were strewn with a free
hand over his tales of the sea. These break a good
many of the rules of rhetoric&mdash;and so do sailors;
they have to do with the breakage of nearly all the
commandments&mdash;and so do sailors. But they are
breezy; they are always pushing forward; spars
and sails are all ship-shape; and so are the sailors’
oaths, and the rattle of the chain-cables, and the
slatting of the gaskets, and the smell of the stews
from the cook’s galley.</p>

<p>There is also a liberal and <i lang="la">quasi</i> democratic coloring
of the links and interludes of his novels.
The trials of <cite>Peter Simple</cite> grow largely out of the
cruel action of the British laws of primogeniture;
nor does the jolly midshipman&mdash;grandson, or
nephew&mdash;forego his satiric raps at my lord
“Privilege.” Yet Marryat shows no special admiration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
for such evolutions of the democratic problem
as he encounters in America.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Upon the whole, one finds no large or fine literary
quality in his books; but the <em>fun</em> in them
is positive, and catching&mdash;as our aunts and
uncles used to find it; but it is the fun of the
tap-room, and of the for’castle, rather than of
the salon, or the library. For all this, scores and
scores of excellent old people were shaking their
sides&mdash;in the early part of this century&mdash;over
the pages of Captain Marryat&mdash;in the days when
other readers with sighs were bemoaning the
loss of the “Great Magician’s” power in the
dreary story of <cite>Count Robert of Paris</cite>, or kindling
into a new worship as they followed Ainsworth’s<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
vivid narrative of Dick Turpin’s daring
gallop from London to York.</p>

<p>A nearer name to us, and one perhaps more
familiar, is that of G. P. R. James,<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> an excellent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
industrious man, who drove his trade of novel-making&mdash;as
our engineers drive wells&mdash;with
steam, and pistons, and borings, and everlasting
clatter.</p>

<p>Yet,&mdash;is this sharp, irreverent mention, wholly
fair to the old gentleman, upon whose confections,
and pastries, so many of us have feasted in times
past? What a delight it was&mdash;not only for youngsters,
but for white-haired judges, and country
lawyers&mdash;to listen for the jingle of the spurs, when
one of Mr. James’s swarthy knights&mdash;“with a grace
induced by habits of martial exercise”&mdash;came
dashing into old country quietudes, with his visor
up; or, perhaps in “a Genoa bonnet of black
velvet, round which his rich chestnut hair coiled
in profusion”&mdash;making the welkin ring with his&mdash;“How
now, Sir Villain!”</p>

<p>I caught sight of this great necromancer of
“miniver furs,” and mantua-making chivalry&mdash;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
youngish days, in the city of New York&mdash;where
he was making a little over-ocean escape
from the multitudinous work that flowed from
him at home; a well-preserved man, of scarce
fifty years, stout, erect, gray-haired, and with
countenance blooming with mild uses of mild
English ale&mdash;kindly, unctuous&mdash;showing no
signs of deep thoughtfulness or of harassing
toil. I looked him over, in boyish way, for
traces of the court splendors I had gazed upon,
under his ministrations, but saw none; nor
anything of the “manly beauty of features,
rendered scarcely less by a deep scar upon the
forehead,”&mdash;nor “of the gray cloth doublets
slashed with purple;” a stanch, honest, amiable,
well-dressed Englishman&mdash;that was all.</p>

<p>And yet, what delights he had conjured for us!
Shall we be ashamed to name them, or to confess
it all? Shall the modern show of new flowerets
of fiction, and of lilies&mdash;forced to the front in
January&mdash;make us forget utterly the old cinnamon
roses, and the homely but fragrant pinks,
which once regaled and delighted us, in the April
and May of our age?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>What incomparable siestas those were, when,
from between half-closed eyelids, we watched for
the advent of the two horsemen&mdash;one in corselet
of shining silver, inlaid with gold, and the other
with hauberk of bright steel rings&mdash;slowly riding
down the distant declivity, under the rays of a
warm, red sunset! Then, there were abundance of
gray castle-walls&mdash;ever so high, the ivy hanging
deliciously about them; and there were clanging
chains of draw-bridges, that rattled when a good
knight galloped over; and there were stalwart
gypsies lying under hedges, with charmingest of
little ones with flaxen hair (who are not gypsies at
all, but only stolen); and there is clash of arms;
and there are bad men, who get punched with
spear heads&mdash;which is good for them; and there
are jolly old burghers who drink beer, and “troll
songs”; and assassins who lurk in the shadows of
long corridors&mdash;where the moonbeams shine upon
their daggers; and there are dark-haired young
women, who look out of casements and kiss their
hands and wave white kerchiefs,&mdash;and somebody
sees it in the convenient edge of the wood, and
salutes in return, and steals away; and the assassin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
escapes, and the gypsies are captured in the bush,
and some bad king is killed, and an old parchment
is found, and the stars come out, and the rivulet
murmurs, and the good knight comes back; and
the dark tresses are at the casement, and she
smiles, and the marriage bells ring, and they are
happy. And the school bell (for supper) rings,
and we are happy!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As I close this book with these last shadowy
glimpses of story-tellers, who have told their
pleasant tales, and have lived out their time, and
gone to rest, I see lifting over that fair British
horizon, where Victoria shows her queenly presence&mdash;the
modest Mr. Pickwick, with his gaiters
and bland expanse of figure; Thackeray, too, with
his stalwart form and spectacled eyes is peering out
searchingly upon all he encounters; the refined face
of Ruskin is also in evidence, and his easy magniloquence
is covering one phase of British art with
new robes. A woman’s Dantesque profile shows
the striking qualities which are fairly mated by
the striking passages in <cite>Adam Bede</cite> and <cite>Daniel
Deronda</cite>; one catches sight, too, of the shaggy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
keen visage of the quarrel-loving Carlyle, and of
those great twin-brethren of poesy&mdash;Browning
and Tennyson&mdash;the Angelo and the Raphael of
latter images in verse. Surely these make up a
wonderful grouping of names&mdash;not unworthy of
comparison with those others whom we found
many generations ago, grouped around another
great queen of England, who blazed in her royal
court, and flaunted her silken robes, and&mdash;is
gone.</p>

friend, Lady Beaumont&mdash;“Surely I have spoken to you of
Mr. Wilson, a young man of some fortune, who has built a
house in a very fine situation not far from Bowness.…
He has from boyhood been a passionate admirer of my
brother’s writings. [And again.] We all, including Mr.
De Quincey and Coleridge, have been to pay the Bachelor
(Wilson) a visit, and we enjoyed ourselves very much in a
pleasant mixture of merriment, and thoughtful discourse.… He
is now twenty-three years of age.”&mdash;Coleorton <cite>Letters</cite>,

Mr. Wilson is as busy studying as possible; indeed, he has
little time before him for his great task; he says it will take
one month at least to make out a catalogue of the books he
has to read and consult. I am perfectly appalled when I go
into the dining-room and see all the folios, quartos, and
duodecimos, with which it is literally filled; and the poor
culprit himself sitting in the midst, with a beard as long and
red as an ancient carrot; for he has not shaved for a fortnight.

edition of Byron’s works, with voluminous notes (in over-fine
print) by William Ernest Henley. The editorial stand-point
may be judged by this averment from the preface,&mdash;“the sole
English poet bred since Milton to live a master-influence in
the world at large.”</p>

<p>Another full edition of works, with editing by Earl of Lovelace
(grandson of Byron), is announced as shortly to appear
from the press of Murray in London, and of Scribners in
New York.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_66" id="Footnote_66"></a><a href="#FNanchor_66"><span class="label">[66]</span></a> This poem appeared about the middle of April, 1816.
The final break in his relations with Lady Byron had occurred,
probably, in early February of the same year. On
December 10, 1815, his daughter Ada was born; and on
April 25th, next ensuing, he sailed away from England
forever. Byron insisted that the poem (“Fare thee well”),
though written in sincerity, was published against his inclinations,
through the over-zeal of a friend.&mdash;<cite>Moore’s Life</cite>, p.

that Godwin told her he wrote the first half of <cite>Caleb Williams</cite>

she destroyed herself, November 10, 1816. At one time there
had been ugly rumors that she was untrue to him; and there is
some reason to believe that Shelley once entertained this belief,
but there is no adequate testimony to that end; Godwin’s

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
